  The Ekawada string-figure app for iOS is submitted to the App Store
---

<p>Last night I finished the <a href="http://www.ekawada.com">marketing site for Ekawada</a> (at least, the first draft of it), plugged the last of the memory leaks reported by the Instruments tool, created some app icons that I finally felt did the app justice, and…and… <span class="caps">YES</span>! I submitted Ekawada to the App Store!</p>
<p>I’ve been told that the review process for new submissions is currently taking a little more than a week, so with a bit of luck Ekawada could be available for download sometime late next week.</p>
<p>I’m giddy!</p>
