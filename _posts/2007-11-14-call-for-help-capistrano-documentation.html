<p>Capistrano’s documentation is, to put it mildly, lacking.</p>
<p>I fully acknowledge that. And I assume all the blame for it, too. I want to do something about it, but I’ve been far, far (far!) too swamped for the last six months to do more than acknowledge the need.</p>
<p>So, I’m pleading for your help. Here’s what I’d like to happen:</p>
<ol>
	<li>I’d like one (maybe two) people to step forward, to volunteer to coordinate the documentation effort. This person would ideally be responsible for identifying what needs to be documented, standardizing on a format for documentation, etc. They would work with me to make sure it fits with my vision for Capistrano, but mostly they would have a free reign to do what needs to be done.</li>
		<li>I’d like as many people as possible to volunteer to submit documentation. This would happen after the coordinator identified what needs to be documented. People would then sign up to take on one of the areas pending documentation. If no action occurs on it within a month or so, that task would automatically become available again for someone else to sign up for.</li>
	</ol>
<p>The documentation thus generated will be hosted at <a href="http://www.capify.org">capify.org</a>.</p>
<p>Thoughts? Volunteers? If you’d like to coordinate the documentation effort, please email me directly (jamis at jamisbuck dot org). We’ll see how many volunteer, and I’ll pick the “winner”. :)</p>
<p>If worse comes to worst, though, and no one volunteers, I’m still determined to work out some skeletal documentation as soon as I finish updating Net::SSH and friends. I have no <span class="caps">ETA</span> on that at this point, though. :(</p>
