<p><a href="http://www.torcs.org"><span class="caps">TORCS</span></a> is a dang cool racing game for Linux. It originated as a racing <em>simulator</em>, in which you would have robots race against robots. It has evolved into a game where you can actually drive one of the cars yourself.</p>
<p>The graphics are amazing. Some of the tracks (like Alpine, or <span class="caps">CG 2</span>) are commercial quality, and many of the cars are painstakingly detailed as well.</p>
<p>It is almost the perfect racing game for Linux. If only it allowed network play, multiple paths through a track (ie, a city or something), and stunts (jumps, loops, etc.), <em>then</em> it would truly rock.</p>
<p>Do I want these features badly enough to dig into the <span class="caps">TORCS</span> code and add them myself?</p>
<p>Hmm.  Probably notâ€¦</p>
