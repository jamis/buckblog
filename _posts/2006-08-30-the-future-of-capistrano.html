<p>I’ve been asked several times recently if I had any plans to implement in Capistrano the things that Dave Thomas mentioned in his <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/06/30/railsconf-2006-keynote-series-dave-thomas">RailsConf keynote address</a>. Not having been there, I had no idea what they were talking about! However, I finally made some time and watched the keynote.</p>
<p>First off, Dave brings up some really good points. The split between developer and sysadmin is a real thing, even if it is one that I don’t wholly agree with. Prerequisites and such are good ideas.</p>
<p>That said, I’m not going to implement them. Or rather, I’m not in a position to implement them right now.</p>
<p>The environments that Dave describes are not the environments I live and work in. If I were to try and implement those things, I’d just be guessing, and I’ve got a pretty bad track record when it comes to guessing what other people need. I’ve learned the hard way to write what I need, and <em>only</em> what I need—and Capistrano, as it stands, is pretty darn close to what I need.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that Capistrano is perfect. It certainly isn’t, and I’ve got plans for further improving it. (In fact, stay tuned for an announcement of a new release, coming up.) However, my vision for Capistrano is not Dave’s vision.</p>
<p>If Dave’s vision happens to be your vision, or if your vision for deployment otherwise differs from mine, then I have a challenge for you: write a deployment system that does what you need it to do. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from Rails, it is that extraction is the only True Way to developing a truly useful system. Perhaps you could be the author of the next generation of Capistrano!</p>
