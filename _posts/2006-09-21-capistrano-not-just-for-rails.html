<p>I am asked periodically if I know of anybody using Capistrano with environments other than Rails. I’ve never had any concrete examples to give them—just rumors and hearsay. Never, that is, until this morning.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com">Simplistic Complexity</a> blog has an article from last month titled <a href="http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/2006/8/16/automated-php-deployment-with-capistrano">Automated <span class="caps">PHP</span> Deployment With Capistrano</a>, which goes step-by-step through the process of setting up Capistrano for a <span class="caps">PHP</span> application, and then using Capistrano to deploy. It <em>can</em> be done!</p>
<p>Furthermore, googling for “java capistrano” returns (besides a few links to cafes in San Juan Capistrano) a few abstracts and articles of people using Capistrano in Java environments. I wish someone would do a blog article on it so I could link it up, but it is heartening to see Ruby sneaking into “enterprise” environments.</p>
