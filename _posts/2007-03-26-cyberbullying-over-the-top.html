<p><a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/as_i_type_this_.html">Kathy Sierra</a>, author of (among other things) the “Creating Passionate Users” weblog, as been receiving death threats. It makes me absolutely <em>sick</em> to think of someone doing this to another human being, and especially to someone as good as Kathy.</p>
<p>I’ve been super busy for the last few weeks, which explains the silence on my blog for that period, but I could not, <em>could not</em> remain silent in the face of this. This kind of bullying behavior is unacceptable. If anyone has any information at all about the people behind the threats, please speak up. This has to stop.</p>
