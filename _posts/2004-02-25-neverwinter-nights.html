<p>I purchased <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com">Neverwinter Nights</a> about a year ago, during a period of time when I was feeling “D&amp;D deprivation” particularly acutely.  It’s been a blast to play, and I’ve really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>For Christmas, Tarasine got me the “Shadows of Udrentide” expansion pack, and that was fun to play.  Like the original single-player campaign, you start out at first level and work your way up.  I think I managed to get to level 12 or so by the end of that one—just high enough to start getting access to the really powerful spells and equipment.</p>
<p>Last week I purchased the “Hordes of the Underdark” expansion pack, and I must admit it is exceptional.  In it, you play a high-level character (mine is currently a 22nd level Wizard) who is “dungeon delving” to solve a mystery.  Lots of cool magical items, monsters, and spells (my favorite so far is “Finger of Death”, although the “Dragon Knight” epic spell is pretty slick, too).</p>
<p>It’s been a great way to pass the time when I’m up at 2 in the morning with Katie.  I hold her on my lap and feed her with one hand, and with the other I point-and-click my way through the various baddies and beasties of the Underdark of Faerun.</p>
