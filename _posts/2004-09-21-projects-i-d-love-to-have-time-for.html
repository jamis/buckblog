<p>If only I weren’t so busy!</p>
<p>There are several projects I keep wishing I had time for. I may start a sidebar to my blog to enumerate them, just so I always have something to do when my current projects terminate. (Ha, ha.)</p>
<ul>
	<li>_An improved <code>mkmf.rb@_. The @mkmf.rb</code> library (“MaKe MakeFile”) is used by C extension libraries to produce portable makefiles. It works really well, except for two things: one, it has <span class="caps">ZERO</span> documentation (which makes it very hard to determine what it can and can’t do), and two, it is very non-object-oriented. I’d love to see a new version of <code>mkmf</code>, that is extensible, documented, and object-oriented.</li>
		<li>
<em>@Net::SSH::Server@</em>. Yup, that’s right—an <span class="caps">SSH</span> server implemented in Ruby.</li>
		<li>
<em>Forum for Blog Article Comments</em>. Rather than integrate comments into a blogging engine, have an external forum running that has one thread per article. Support minimal user authentication to prevent automated spamming. (<a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net">whytheluckystiff</a> used to do something like this…doesn’t look like he does anymore, though.)</li>
		<li>
<em>Database Abstraction Layer using Copland</em>. Something like Ruby/DBI, only powered by <a href="http://copland.rubyforge.org">Copland</a>.</li>
		<li>
<em>Object Relational Mapping using Copland</em>. Something like <a href="http://activerecord.rubyonrails.org">ActiveRecord</a>, but using Copland to tie it all together.</li>
		<li>
<em><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry">Tapestry</a> in Ruby</em>. Something like I did with Copland, taking ideas from HiveMind, except I’d like to do the same with Tapestry.</li>
		<li>
<em>Blogging Engine</em>. Don’t get me wrong—Rublog is great. But I still think there is room for another great blogging engine…</li>
		<li>
<em>Ruby Plug-in for XChat</em>. I’ve already written one of these, but it’s rather buggy and I think I could do much better now.</li>
	</ul>
