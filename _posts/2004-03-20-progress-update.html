<p>Well, I’ve got Gnome up and running, and the network (wired) works.  Sound doesn’t work yet, but then I haven’t spent much time on that.  The last 3 hours have been focussed on getting the wireless card working with the <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net">ndiswrapper</a> driver… Mixed success so far.  It seems to find the card okay, and to load the driver, but then I can’t set the <span class="caps">ESSID</span> and it can’t seem to find any wrieless networks.  (And yet, the computer sitting right next to-<del>the one that I’m typing this note on right now</del>-is connected to the Internet via a wireless connection, so I know there is one.)</p>
<p>I’m far to tired.  It’s time to sleep, I guess.  Here’s hoping for better luck tomorrow.</p>
