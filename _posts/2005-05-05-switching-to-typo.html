<p>Everyone’s doing it. I’m feeling peer pressure. And besides, Typo’s <em>cool</em>.</p>
<p>So, I’ll be switching to <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">Typo</a> in the near future (meaning, maybe tomorrow, or the next day). Prepare to have the <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds break—when they do, just come back and subscribe to the new ones. Bookmarks to existing articles will all break as well.</p>
<p>I’ve almost got everything in place to make the switch—I’m just tweaking the interface so that it looks more like <em>this</em> blog than the default Typo look-and-feel.</p>
