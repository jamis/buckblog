<p>For today’s tip, I’m going to be cheap and just point you at someone else’s post. :) It’s a good post, though, and it fits right in with my recent posts on <span class="caps">RJS</span>, so I think it’s fair. Also, since I posted to <a href="http://www.therailsway.com">The Rails Way</a> this morning, I don’t think too much should be expected of me today, blog-wise!</p>
<p>So, the pointer: <a href="http://rails.co.za/articles/2007/01/13/rjs-refactoring"><span class="caps">RJS</span> Refactoring</a>. Find yourself doing a lot of the same thing in your <span class="caps">RJS</span> code? This tip’s for you. (Thanks for writing that up, Gustav!)</p>
