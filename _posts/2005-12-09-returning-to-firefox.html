<p>Since moving to the Mac in March of this year, I made a 7-month effort to fall in love with Safari. I almost succeeded, especially since the default look-and-feel of Firefox on the Mac is excrutiating. However, there was just enough pain involved in using Safari that I began to look at making Firefox my default browser again. In particular:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Safari makes debugging Javascript very, very painful. Often, you’ll get an error message with a line number of 0. The only way to debug those are to throw alerts everywhere. That, or use Firefox (or <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a>, which really seems to have figured out how to report JS errors, backtrace and all!).</li>
		<li>The tab key never seems to behave like I expect in Safari. I’ve tried the various options for changing its behavior, but it still surprises me. I haven’t really tried to sit down and define <em>why</em> it surprises me, but Firefox seems to behave more in keeping with my expectations.</li>
		<li>The tab key in dialogs in Safari never seems to work—I have to explicitly point-and-click when I want to click something other than the default button. <em>Grrr!</em>
</li>
		<li>Safari doesn’t have <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a>! I decided I wanted to see what all this <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/-h/hoodwinkDDayOneForcingTheHostToAttendTheParty.html">hoodwinkiness</a> is about, and it was too much of a pain to have both Firefox and Safari open at once.</li>
	</ul>
<p>So, I turned to Google to see if I could solve the look-and-feel issues I had with Firefox on the Mac. And, lo and behold! I found the following nuggets of wonder and beauty:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.grapple.net.tf/">GrApple</a> is a very nice <span class="caps">OSX</span>-ish theme for Firefox. Makes it look much (much!) nicer. (Unfortunately, at the time of this writing the site appears to be having problems…hopefully that gets resolved soon.)</li>
		<li>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=785">Tab X</a> is a Firefox extension that puts the “X” button (for closing tabs) on each tab.</li>
		<li>
<a href="http://www.amake.us/software/firefoxy/">Firefoxy</a> is a MacOS app that updates your Firefox chrome to make form widgets look a bit more like <span class="caps">OS X</span> widgets. (Just a bit—but it’s a lot better than the klunky Win32 look that Firefox sports otherwise.)</li>
	</ul>
<p>Furthermore, Firefox has a feature that lets you import your Safari bookmarks! Very nice. It even preserved the contents of my bookmarks toolbar, which I had set up <em>just so</em> in Safari and was a bit trepidatious about replacing.</p>
<p>These, taken together with the speed improvements in Firefox 1.5, make using Firefox on the Mac <em>much</em> nicer. I now use Firefox exclusively, and only dust Safari off every now and then for testing.</p>
