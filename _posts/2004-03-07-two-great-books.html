<p>I often read two books in parallel, which is not to say simultaneously.  I’ll read from one for a few days, and then read from the other for a few days.  It helps me feel like I’m covering more ground or something.</p>
<p>As a result of this strategy, I finished reading two great books yesterday: Tad Williams’ “The War of the Flowers” and “The Price of the Stars” by Debra Doyle and James D. Macdonald.</p>
<p>I’ve actually been reading “War of the Flowers” for about two months now-<del>books don’t usually take so long for me to read, but we had a baby when I was about half through it.  I finished it, though, and I’m glad I did</del>-it was definately one of Williams’ best books.</p>
<p>It deals with a man named Theo Vilmos, who finds himself caught up in a deadly game of interspecies politics when he is swept into the realm of Faerie.  However, this version of Faerie is like something out of a horror film—modern, dirty, and oppressive.  It’s a gripping read from start to finish, with a pretty spectacular ending.</p>
<p>My one complaint is the language he uses, and I don’t mean Greek.  He drops the F-bomb several times, unecessarily.  For that reason alone I will not purchase the book, although if I could get an electronic copy of it that I could edit I would happily bleep out the foul language and print all umpteen-hundred pages of it.  There was also an extremely predictable sex “scene”, though it wasn’t very explicit.</p>
<p>“Price of the Stars” was the first book in a trilogy, though it stands on its own very well.  It feels like a cross between “Star Wars” and “Mission Impossible”, very intense and fast-paced.  It deals with a woman’s quest for vengeance against her mother’s murderers, in a galaxy recently ravaged by war against the “Magelords”, a group of magic-wielding outsiders.  Immensely enjoyable.</p>
<p>My next two books to read are “New Spring: the Novel” by Robert Jordan and “Crystal City” by Orson Scott Card, two of my favorite authors.</p>
