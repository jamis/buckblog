<p>I released <a href="http://copland.rubyforge.org">Copland</a> 0.3.0 “Canticle of Freedom” a few days ago. I’ve really enjoyed working on it, even if most of the Ruby community still hasn’t grasped why it’s a slick tool.</p>
<p>My next big task is to write “Chump Change”, my web-based personal financial package. It will be the real test of Copland’s feature set and stability (since I plan to use Copland to implement it).  Once Chump Change is out the door, I’ll bump Copland’s version number to 1.0 and call it good. Hopefully, working on Chump Change will identify the weak areas in Copland.</p>
<p>I still have several tutorials to write for Copland as well, to document it’s features. I suppose those will have to be written before the 1.0 version bump as well.</p>
<p>So much to do, so little time.</p>
