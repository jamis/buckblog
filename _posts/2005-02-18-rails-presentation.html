<p>So, I gave my <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> presentation to the <a href="http://www.ujug.org">Utah Java Users Group</a> last night, and it went very well. I also was able to meet <a href="http://www.howardlewisship.com/blog">Howard Lewis Ship</a> in person, finally, which was a treat.</p>
<p>My presentation was sandwiched between a <span class="caps">JDO</span> presentation, and Howard’s presentation on Tapestry. It was neat to see Rails compared side-by-side with Tapestry, which is one of the premier web-frameworks for Java. I think there is plenty that can be learned on both sides. It would be interesting to see Rails with an object-component model like Tapestry has (but I say that quietly, because I’m not necessarily up to volunteering to write it!).</p>
<p>If you’re interested, you can view my presentation online (in an incredibly ugly format, but I blame <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OOo</a> for that) <a href="http://ruby.jamisbuck.org.nyud.net:8090/ujug-presentation/Ruby%20on%20Rails.html">right here</a>. Alternative, you can download the whole thing (<strong>warning: 14 meg download</strong>) <a href="http://ruby.jamisbuck.org.nyud.net:8090/ujug-presentation.tar.bz2">here</a>.</p>
