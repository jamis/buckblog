<p>I’m loving the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/capistrano">Capistrano mailing list</a>. Several times per week, someone will point out some new tip or trick that they are using with Capistrano, which blows me away.</p>
<p>Today, Chris McGrath posted a link to a blog article by rabble entitled <a href="http://blog.testingrails.com/2006/9/4/running-tests-on-deploy-with-capistrano">Running Tests on Deploy with Capistrano</a>. If you’ve ever wanted to have your tests automatically run when you deploy your app, and rollback if the tests fail, you ought to check it out. He’s even got a recipe for dealing with the case of multiple deployment targets, all of which want to run the tests simultaneously.</p>
<p>Good stuff!</p>
