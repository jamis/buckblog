<p>My wife and I found a babysitter this afternoon and went and saw <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0363771/">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a>. I’ve been especially curious about the film after reading afew scathing reviews lambasting it for its “religious themes”.</p>
<p>Well, I absolutely <em>loved</em> the movie. I haven’t been so moved by a film in a long time. The acting was superb, the scenery was beautiful, and the special effects were great. The religious themes are certainly there, if you look for them (but they’re in Lord of the Rings, too, if you look for them, and no one ever condemned that film for it).</p>
<p>I never see a film twice in the theater, but I would definitely make an exception for this one.</p>
