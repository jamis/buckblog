<p>Just a heads-up to say that I’ll be out of town for the next several days, returning to Idaho on Thursday night. My wife and I are flying to Chicago tomorrow morning to attend 37signals’ <a href="http://workshop.37signals.com">Getting Real workshop</a> on Monday, and we’ll be touring the town for a couple days afterward.</p>
<p>I’m still working on the next “Under the hood” article, which will explore route generation in Rails. It’s a hairy one, which is why it’s taking longer to write than the <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/10/2/under-the-hood-rails-routing-dsl">other</a> <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/10/4/under-the-hood-route-recognition-in-rails">two</a>, but I hope to be able to post it sometime next week (probably Friday).</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
