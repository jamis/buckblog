<p>I was interviewed twice recently, once by Robert Evans (of <a href="http://godbit.com">The Godbit Project</a>) and once by Satish Talim (of <a href="http://rubylearning.com">RubyLearning.com</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://godbit.com/article/jamis-buck-the-interview">Godbit.com interview</a> covers my introduction to computers, how I discovered Ruby, how I balance my time, and more. It was a real pleasure to chat with Robertâ€”thanks for the interview!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2007/09/27/advice-for-ruby-beginners-1/">RubyLearning.com interview</a> is actually just part 1 of 3, the rest of which will be published next week. This interview is an aggregation of responses from 13 different Ruby developers from around the world, and I was honored to be included.</p>
