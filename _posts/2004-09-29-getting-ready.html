<p>Tomorrow I leave for Virginia! I’m pretty excited, but nervous too, hoping that everything comes together to get me to the conference in one piece. I’ve touched up my presentation a bit (adding a few more slides, so now I <em>know</em> it’s going to be too long). I’ve also worked hard on Copland, getting it ready for the big 1.0 release. I feel really good about it—I hope I can do it justice at the conference. I read things like <a href="http://homepages.ihug.com.au/~naseby/64.html">this</a> and despair of ever helping people see how cool IoC (and Copland, specifically) really is. :(</p>
