<p>Inspired by the original list of <a href="/jamis/archives/000014.html">Klingon Programmers</a> sayings, I hunted around the web and found a few more that are worth mentioning:</p>
<ol>
	<li>C++? That is for children. A Klingon Warrior uses only machine code, keyed in on the front panel switches in raw binary.</li>
		<li>Klingon multitasking systems do not support “time-sharing”. When a Klingon program wants to run, it challenges the scheduler in hand-to-hand combat and owns the machine.</li>
		<li>Perhaps it <strong>IS</strong> a good day to die! I say we ship it!</li>
	</ol>
