<p><a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com">Fabio Akita</a> recently interviewed me, and he has posted the transcript on his website, in both <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/2007/8/3/chatting-with-jamis-buck">English</a> and <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/2007/8/6/conversando-com-jamis-buck">Portuguese</a>. It was a really nice experience, chatting with him. We talked about how I got into computer programming, how I came to Ruby, and what Iâ€™m up to these days. Thanks for the interview, Fabio!</p>
