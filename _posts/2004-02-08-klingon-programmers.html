<p>Okay, I was up at 2:30 this morning with Katie (my week-old daughter) and was reading [<a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>].  The poll was about the best hand-held weapon, I was reading through the comments that various slashdotters had posted, and I came across [<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=95819&amp;cid=8208868">this gem</a>]:</p>
<h2>Top 12 Things a Klingon Programmer Would Say</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Specifications are for the weak and timid!</li>
		<li>This machine is a piece of <strong><span class="caps">GAGH</span></strong>! I need dual Pentium processors if Iam to do battle with this code!</li>
		<li>You cannot really appreciate Dilbert unless you’ve read it in the original Klingon.</li>
		<li>Indentation?!—I will show you how to indent when I indent your skull!</li>
		<li>What is this talk of ‘release’? Klingons do not make software’ releases’. Our software ‘escapes’ leaving a bloody trail of designers and quality assurance people in its wake.</li>
		<li>Klingon function calls do not have ‘parameters’ <del>- they have ‘arguments’ -</del> and they <span class="caps">ALWAYS WIN THEM</span>.</li>
		<li>Debugging? Klingons do not debug. Our software does not coddle the weak.</li>
		<li>I have challenged the entire quality assurance team to a Bat-Leth contest. They will not concern us again.</li>
		<li>
<span class="caps">A TRUE</span> Klingon Warrior does not comment his code!</li>
		<li>By filing this <span class="caps">SPR</span> you have challenged the honor of my family. Prepare to die!</li>
		<li>You question the worthiness of my code? I should kill you where you stand!</li>
		<li>Our users will know fear and cower before our software. Ship it! Ship it, and let them flee like the dogs they are!</li>
	</ol>
