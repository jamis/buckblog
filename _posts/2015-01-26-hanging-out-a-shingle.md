After [announcing last week](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2015/1/20/getting-back-in-the-pool.html) that I was looking for a team to work with, I was overwhelmed (in the best way) by the amount of interest that was expressed. I'm sure I could have selected any of those offers and worked with great relish on any of the projects that were proposed. It was a long week, with a lot of difficult decisions involved.

In the end, though, and with the help and advice of some awesome friends, I've decided that the best way forward for me is to hang out a shingle of my own and try my hand at some independent consulting. It's a humbling and more-than-slightly terrifying step, since it's not something I've ever done, or ever imagined doing, but I'm really, really excited about it.

I'll be creating a dedicated page for the consulting side of things once I've got more details ironed out. Thanks to everyone who contacted me---your support and encouragement have been invaluable!

Let's see where this journey takes me...
