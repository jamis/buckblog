<p>Today I released <a href="http://copland.rubyforge.org">Copland</a> 0.1.0 “Fanfare for the Common Programmer”.  Copland is an inversion of control container (similar to [<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/hivemind">Hivemind</a>]) for the Ruby programming language.</p>
<p>It’s been a pretty wild ride today.  After about 4 days of work on Copland, I finally released it.  My intention was to name it after the American composer Aaron Copland, but I spelled the name wrong… the first release was labeled “Copeland”.  Oops.</p>
<p>So, after some juggling and rushing, I managed to get that little typo fixed (thanks to lots of help from various people in the Ruby community.  Tom Copeland, who runs [<a href="http://rubyforge.org">RubyForge</a>], has been especially helpful).</p>
<p>This was a great opportunity for me to learn more about the <a href="http://rubygems.rubyforge.org">RubyGems</a> project, a new way of packaging and distributing Ruby libraries.  It is <em>really</em> slick.  I mean, slicker than anything I’ve seen for Ruby in a long time.  And so easy to use!</p>
<p>At any rate, it’s time for bed, if I can get Katie to sleep.  She just had about 3 ounces of forumla and is acting wide awake… argh…</p>
