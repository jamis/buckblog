<p>I finally finished reading <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>, by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt. I’d long intended to read it, and a month ago I found it at Barnes and Noble. Having a gift certificate from Christmas to spend, I picked it up.</p>
<p>I really, really liked it. I’ve already found myself changing how I write software. The biggest change I’ve noticed in myself is that I am now trying to think about how I write software, and why I make various decisions while programming. It’s the kind of book, though, that you need to review periodically. I’ll definitely be keeping it handy.</p>
<p>Next on my bookshelf to read: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321278658/103-0414991-3635853">Extreme Programming Explained</a>, by Kent Beck.</p>
