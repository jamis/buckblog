  The author's Ekawada app for iOS is finally approved for sale on the
  App Store
---

<p>Last night I received a long-awaited email: <a href="http://www.ekawada.com">Ekawada</a> is finally <a href="http://bit.ly/gsRpks">approved for sale</a> in the App Store!</p>
<p>It’s been a pretty wild ride, from start to finish. The first commit was made on May 25, but I’d been tinkering on it for at least a month before that, learning Objective-C and Cocoa and basically trying to prove to myself that this was something I could actually build. The app was submitted to the App Store on November 3rd, rejected (due to a bug in Ekawada) on the 11th, resubmitted, and finally accepted just last night. And here I am, almost 6 months since that initial commit, offering my creation to the world.</p>
<p>Really exhilarating. Even if no one else likes what I’ve built, I’ve learned a lot, and since I built the app primarily for myself, there will always be at least one passionate user!</p>
<p>So, the sales pitch: if you have an iOS device (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch) with at least iOS 3.0, head on over to the App Store and <a href="http://bit.ly/gsRpks">download Ekawada</a>. It’s <strong>free</strong>, comes with eight figures for you to learn, and includes nine tutorials to help you along. And if you happen to like what you see, there are almost 100 more figures (in 5 packs) available for purchase in-app, $0.99 per pack.</p>
<p>And let me know what you think, either with ratings and reviews in the App Store, comments here, notes on <a href="http://twitter.com/jamis">Twitter</a>, or even just an old-fashioned email.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
