<p>What an <em>incredible</em> weekend.</p>
<p>I just got back from <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf 2005</a> last night. Late. I would have blogged about it as it was occurring but I was spending every spare minute I had hacking on Rails, gearing up for the release of 1.0 <span class="caps">RC1</span>.</p>
<p>So, now that I have a minute, I figured I’d sit and write about some of my impressions.</p>
<p>It was definitely unforgettable. Almost 200 Rubyists packed into a conference room, Mac laptops everywhere (<em>are you PC folks feeling any pressure to change, yet?</em>) and ideas and code flying fast and furious. I finally got to meet most of the Rails core team face-to-face, which was a real treat. I am honored to be a part of that group.</p>
<p>Late nights, hacking. Every night. Combine that with early mornings (to get a decent seat) and you wind up with a real recipe for sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>I loved listening to Matz talk about Ruby, although it was unfortunate that so many people turned his keynote into a “why can’t you just…” session. Still, I was very impressed with how he handled that, listening to people and responding politely.</p>
<p>Probably the most life-changing thing that occurred at the conference was that I decided to give <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a> another try. It has certainly progressed quite a bit since I <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2005/04/10/text-editing-dilemma">last tried it</a>, and although I do miss the implementation of some of vim’s features (like joining the next line with the current—TextMate does it, too, but not as cleanly) I think I could grow to love TextMate. The hard part now is learning how to be effective in this new editor. Having used a mode-based editor for so long, it’s difficult to remember how to use anything else!</p>
