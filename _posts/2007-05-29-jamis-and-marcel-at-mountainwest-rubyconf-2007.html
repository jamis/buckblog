  Announcing the video of a presentation in which the author and Marcel
  Molina co-delivered a live code review
---

<p><a href="http://project.ioni.st">Marcel Molina, Jr.</a> and I were able to attend the <a href="http://mtnwestruby.org/">MountainWest Ruby Conference</a> back in March. At the last minute, one of the speakers was unable to attend, so <a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/">Pat Eyler</a> asked Marcel and me if we wouldnâ€™t mind doing a live code review. One of the sponsors of the conference, <a href="http://cosl.usu.edu/"><span class="caps">COSL</span></a>, graciously (and courageously!) provided a Rails project that we could pick apart.</p>
<p>The 45-minute presentation is <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf2007.confreaks.com/session10.html">now available on the Confreaks website</a>. The TextMate window is a bit hard to read, but if you squint just right you can make it all out. :) Considering that Marcel and I only had an hour to prepare, I think it turned out pretty well!</p>
