Oops. I forgot to link up the previous week's challenge. I'll keep trying to remember to post them here, for those that are following this blog. Feel free to [ping me](http://twitter.com/jamis) if you notice I've forgotten again.

This week's challenge (the seventh!) is _B+ trees_. The goal is to implement a B+ tree, and there are lots of opportunities to rack up additional points once you've got the basics down. Check it out, and give it a try: [Weekly Programming Challenge #7](https://medium.com/@jamis/weekly-programming-challenge-7-286640364537).
