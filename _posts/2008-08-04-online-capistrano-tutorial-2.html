<p>The first online Capistrano tutorial session was very successful, thanks to everyone who participated. Now, it’s time to try again!</p>
<p>The second online Capistrano tutorial session is now open for registration: <a href="http://events.capify.org/events/2">http://events.capify.org/events/2</a>.</p>
<p>It is scheduled for Wednesday, August 13th, at 7pm (Mountain time), and will last two hours (plus up to an hour at the end for Q&amp;A). As before, this tutorial is targeted at <em>beginning</em> Capistrano users, those will little or no prior experience. (If you’re looking for a session for more advanced users, keep watching this space—I’ll probably do one of those eventually, as soon as I can write a curriculum for it.)</p>
