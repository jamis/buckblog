  An amusing incident involving the English alphabet and the
  author's two-year-old daughter
---

<p>My daughter, who is almost 3, has been learning the alphabet. Today, when my wife asked her what comes after Y, she answered, “N!”</p>
<p>She insisted it was so, because the song goes ”...W, X, <span class="caps">Y N Z</span>.”</p>
