<p>I was recently pointed at <a href="http://infinitenil.com/phoneword/">Phonewords</a>, a Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span> Cocoa application for discovering words hidden in your phone number(s). It’s a fun little program—the free version will give you up to ten words, and for $10 you can register and have it give you every word it can find.</p>
<p>It also comes with an address book plugin that allows you to generate and select phonewords from within your address book. (There’s even a <a href="http://infinitenil.com/phoneword/PhoneWordPluginMovie.mov">demo movie</a> that shows off this feature).</p>
<p>The sad news is that my phone number doesn’t work out to anything meaningful. My cell-phone number at least gave me something memorable. But whether you get anything meaningful or not, it’s still a fun app to play with.</p>
