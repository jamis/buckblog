<p>So, I’m almost completely converted to <a href="http://www.macromates.com">TextMate</a>. However, I discovered that it had no syntax highlighting support for Haskell, and googling for one didn’t turn up anything. So I did what any self-respecting programmer would do—I put one together, myself.</p>
<p>It is currently pretty minimal (it doesn’t support any folding yet, and it only really supports as much of the syntax as I currently understand), but it’s a start. It also supports <code>lhs</code> files by combining the Haskell syntax with the LaTeX bundle that comes with TextMate.</p>
<p>Hopefully these will be useful to someone. If you add anything to them, please send the addition back to me so I can add it to my copy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jamisbuck.org/files/Haskell.tmbundle.tar.gz">Haskell.bundle</a> (.tar.gz file, 1k)</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I’ve been given commit access to the TextMate bundles repository, and have <a href="http://anon:anon@macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Bundles/Haskell.tmbundle/">added Haskell there</a>.</p>
