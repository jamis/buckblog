I _so_ wanted to have something cool to show everyone this week, but it didn't quite happen! This is as close I got:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JavaScript torus maze + three.js <a href="https://t.co/njrAYFkSxG">pic.twitter.com/njrAYFkSxG</a></p>&mdash; Jamis Buck (@jamis) <a href="https://twitter.com/jamis/status/680548046950670337">December 26, 2015</a></blockquote>

I spent the week squeezing some programming time in between family activities, and I managed to learn the basics of [three.js](http://threejs.org/), and wrangle several infuriating math and orientation errors, finally getting an animation that was _almost_ correct. (See above. I've found a few issues that keep it from being all that I'd hoped.) 

Hopefully I'll have the finished product available to show by next Saturday...
