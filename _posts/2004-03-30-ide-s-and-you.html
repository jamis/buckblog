<p>I’ve never been much of an <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym> guy.  I much prefer <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a>, having spent about 5 years paying the price to become proficient at it.</p>
<p>Read on for my recent experiences with <span class="caps">IDE</span>’s.</p>
<p>At work, as part of our move to Java, we have decided to make <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> the <span class="caps">IDE</span> of choice.  That is not to say that all developers will be forced to use Eclipse, but for new hires and those without a strong preference, it is the <span class="caps">IDE</span> we will foist on them.</p>
<p>I’ve tried Eclipse 2.x and was not impressed.  The interface was clunky, hard to decode, and definately not as easy to use as Vim (though I say that as someone who has used Vim extensively for several years).</p>
<p>I was recently introduced to <a href="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit</a>, which is much closer to what I would like in an <span class="caps">IDE</span>. It is light, without a lot of features, but it has an <em>incredible</em> file browser.  I’ve since created a work-alike in Ruby-GTK2, which works well with Vim.  It’s still not as full-featured as jEdit’s browser, but it works.</p>
<p>I’m in the middle of installing Eclipse 3, milestone 8, and I have to admit I’m feeling optimistic.  Several developers here have been using it, and although it is still not feature-complete (at least one more milestone to go, due in about 6 weeks), it is supposedly much better than 2.x.  Reading about it, it sounds quite nice, too.</p>
<p>So.  I’ll try it for a little while, and perahps blog about it later.</p>
