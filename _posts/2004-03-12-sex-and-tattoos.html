<p>Today at work we held the “close-out” meeting for the Keystone project (whose purpose was to research the various Java enterprise frameworks that are available and come up with strategic recommendations for our own development environment).</p>
<p>Also today, headlines announced the disciplining of several of <span class="caps">BYU</span>’s football players in regards to a sex scandal that recently occurred.  Such behavior is contrary to <span class="caps">BYU</span>’s honor code, which all students here have agreed to abide by (football player or no).</p>
<p>One of the chief engineers at the meeting today was bemoaning the fact that the honor code seems to have a double standard, with some breaches of it being punished and others being dealt with more leniently.  “What,” he asked, giving a for-instance, “is the different between sex and tattoos?”  (Tattoos are also contrary to the <span class="caps">BYU</span> honor code.)</p>
<p>Dan Wells, our resident comedian, leapt into the contemplative silence that followed and asked, with a confused expression, “You don’t know the difference between sex and tattoos?”</p>
