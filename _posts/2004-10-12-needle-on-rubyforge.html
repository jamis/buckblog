<p><a href="http://needle.rubyforge.org">Needle</a> is now on <a href="http://rubyforge.org">RubyForge</a>!</p>
<p>That is to say, the <em>source code</em> is in <span class="caps">CVS</span> on RubyForge… still no packaged releases, but now that it is in <span class="caps">CVS I</span> feel better about hacking on it. I can now rollback to previous versions if my experiments go sour. :)</p>
<p>(For those of you that don’t know: Needle is my new dependency injection container for Ruby. It’s coming along quite nicely!)</p>
