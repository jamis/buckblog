<p>I was told today on a mailing list that some people have been justifying their coding decisions by saying things like “but that’s how Jamis does it!”</p>
<p>And I was mortified. Because someday a time will come (and likely already has!) when the things I’ve written will be surpassed by a better way, and I will wilt with embarrassment if anyone uses “that’s how Jamis does it” to justify continuing with the antiquated style.</p>
<p>I’m learning, constantly. Every project I undertake teaches me something new. Every programmer I’ve ever worked with has shown me a better way to do things. “How X does it” (for absolutely any mortal value of X) is a moving target, and if you’re blindly basing your designs on something I (or anyone else) wrote a year or two ago, then you should step cautiously.</p>
<p><em>Never</em>. <em>Ever</em>. <em>Cargo-cult</em>. If someone writes about something that you find clever, <em>understand why you think it is clever</em>. If someone preaches a better algorithm, <em>understand why the algorithm is better</em>. And if someone asks why you do something a certain way, argue it on it’s own merits, without resorting to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_authority">appeal to someone’s (supposed) authority</a>. If you can argue that something is better than something else solely by contrasting it’s pros and cons against the alternative, you’ll be taken much more seriously. <em>And</em> you’ll have a much better chance of recognizing a better way when it is presented to you.</p>
<p>I’ll say it again. <em>Never</em>. <em>Ever</em>. <em>Cargo-cult</em>. Ever.</p>
<p>That said, I’ve been very, very quiet lately, and I apologize. I’ve been rethinking some priorities and experimenting with some <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/762-discovering-a-new-interest-whittling">new interests</a>. Also, I’ve been trying to finish up (finally) Net::SSH v2 and Net::SFTP v2. Hopefully this year I’ll climb out of the hole I dug for myself last year and have more to blog about again.</p>
