<p>Why did this strike me as funny?</p>
<p>I’m the <a href="http://www.scouting.org/nav/enter.jsp?s=cy">webelos</a> leader for our local cub scout pack (sponsored by our ward—which is just what we call a congregation of members of the <a href="http://www.mormon.org"><span class="caps">LDS</span></a> Church). Tonight we had a pack meeting, and after all was said and done, cookies were served for the snack. Soft, store-bought sugar cookies, with a thick layer of bright pink, white, and blue frosting, with sprinkles on them. Very festive.</p>
<p>We didn’t have a very good turn out at the meeting, so there were lots of cookies left over. Our Bishop (the title given to a leader of an <span class="caps">LDS</span> congregation) was asked what could be done with the leftovers, and after thinking a moment he offered to take them and use them at a funeral that was going to be held in the next couple of days…</p>
<p>So. Anyone else find that vaguely humorous? And if so, why? Is it because of the thought of sugar cookies at a funeral (and these are not exactly somber-looking cookies), or is it the thought of reusing leftover cookies from a scouting activity at a funeral?</p>
<p>Anyway, it give Tarasine and me a chuckle this evening.</p>
