<p>People attribute a lot of magic behavior to <code>ActiveRecord::Base.find</code>, and rightly so. It does a <em>lot</em> of different things. Want to find a record by id? Done. Multiple records by id? Done. Records based on custom conditions, including associations (arbitrarily deep), and limit the result? Done, done, and done.</p>
<p>However, all this magic comes at a price: the implementation of <code>find</code> is non-trivial.</p>
<p>I’d like to help people better understand how <code>find</code> works. By understanding what it does and how it does it, you’ll be able to make better decisions about your own applications, such as when eager loading of associations might be a bad idea, or what kinds of indexes your tables need.</p>
<p>So, next week (Thanksgiving notwithstanding) I’ll work on getting the first installment out. I learned one very important thing from the last “Under the hood” series I did: don’t write monstrously long articles, because most people won’t read them. So, this series will consist of much shorter, more bite-sized looks at specific parts of the #find implementation. Stay tuned!</p>
