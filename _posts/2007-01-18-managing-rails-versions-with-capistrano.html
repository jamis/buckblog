<p>The simplest way to deploy your application and tie that release to a specific Rails version is to put Rails in your vendor directory as an svn:external dependency. That’s fine, but it’s not very efficient, and <a href="http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom">Mike Clark</a> has posted an <a href="http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/01/19#ManagingVersionsWithCap">excellent writeup of the alternatives</a>. If you’ve been wondering if there is a better way, you could do a lot worse than to read what he’s got to say.</p>
<p>Good stuff, Mike!</p>
