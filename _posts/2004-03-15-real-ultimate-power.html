<p>If you haven’t seen <a href="http://www.realultimatepower.net">The Official Ninja Webpage</a> yet, then you really should take a peek at it.  It’s definately one of the quirkiest sites on the ‘Net, and it has gathered quite a following.</p>
<p>That said, I was reading <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/04/03/13/1954216.shtml?tid=118&amp;tid=187">this Slashdot article</a>  that a coworker pointed out to me.  One of my favorite things about <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> is the ability for readers to post comments about the articles.  Sometimes, the conversations veer far off-topic, and <em>sometimes</em>, they’re even funny.  In this case, one of the comments directed me to [<a href="http://www.rpi.edu/~harmsj/RUPEE/">this site</a>], proving once again that Electrical Engineers are the <em>true</em> custodians of <em>real ultimate power!</em></p>
