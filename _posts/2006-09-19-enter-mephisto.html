  The migration to a new blog engine is finished, and a new design is
  presented for the Buckblog

<p>Alright! I’ve finally finished my migration to <a href="http://www.mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a>. I’ve tried to set up redirects and such so that all existing links and feeds will still work, but there are (no doubt) things I’ve missed. If you notice anything broken, please let me know.</p>
<p>With that migration out of the way, I should finally have some time to start blogging again. I’d like to start documenting some of the new features in <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/2006/9/14/capistrano-1-2-0">Capistrano 1.2</a>, among other things. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you’ve been subscribed to my feed, you may want to update the link. I’m going through feedburner now, so you’ll need to click the “Articles” link in the sidebar on the right, and go through that whole song-and-dance. Many thanks!</p>
