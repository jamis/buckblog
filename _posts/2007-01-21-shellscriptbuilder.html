<p><a href="http://brainspl.at">Ezra Zygmuntowicz</a> announced today a first revision of <a href="http://brainspl.at/articles/2007/01/22/shellscriptbuilder-for-capistrano">ShellScriptBuilder</a>. It lets you use a Ruby <span class="caps">DSL</span> to generate shell scripts (currently only the bash dialect is supported). This is good stuff—I know I <em>always</em> forget how to do things like if statements and such in shell, and have to spend time poring over the man page and experimenting. Even better, the eventual goal with this is to tie it into Capistrano, so that you can specify your commands using Ruby instead of shell script. I’m looking forward to it!</p>
