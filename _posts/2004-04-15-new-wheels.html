<p>Not much to say, except that we decided to go with the Odyssey. We purchased an LX last night, and we’re quite pleased with it. It’s beige in color, and drives very nicely.  The best feature, though, is the space. It can hold our double stroller laying down flat in the back. <em>Very</em> impressive.</p>
