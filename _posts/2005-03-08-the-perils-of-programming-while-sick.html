<p>So, I knew my turn was coming. My one-year-old daughter was quite sick about a week and a half ago, running a temperature of 106F. We even took her to the emergency room for that one, though her fever was all but gone by the next morning.</p>
<p>Then, my wife got sick. No fever, but she got the aches, the cough, the congestion, etc.</p>
<p>Then, my son. A mid-grade fever most of yesterday and this morning, but fortunately he’s such a hardy little fellow (at all of three years old) that even at the worst of it he was still cheerful, if tired.</p>
<p>Yesterday was when I felt my turn really coming on. I felt that scratchy, dry feeling in my throat that we all dread. This morning I also started feeling a tingling in my nose and sinuses. Then the aches set in. And the congestion. And the cough.</p>
<p>And the drowsiness.</p>
<p>And that was when I meant to type <code>rm -rf /var/www/releases</code> (while testing a new release manager for Basecamp on our development box). Instead, my fevered fingers refused to type more than <code>/var/www</code>...</p>
<p>All I can say is, thank goodness for file permissions and quick (if clumsy) reflexes. Even so, I managed to delete at least one directory that was actually missed—fortunately most of it was recovered. Jason and Ryan got a good laugh out of it, all while I blushed fiercely crimson. What a way to go and impress my new employer with all my l33t sk1llz…</p>
<p>Anyway. They’re all very forgiving, and I certainly appreciate that. I’m not usually such a clutz!</p>
<p>Finally, let me just take a minute to praise <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David</a>. Yah, he gets plenty of that, especially in connection with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>, but I have been very impressed with how easy he is to work with. Many people (<strong>cough</strong> me <strong>cough</strong>) have a difficult time “letting go” of a project enough to let someone new actually work in it unsupervised. David, on the other hand, not only lets me go unsupervised (though that might change with the recent <code>rm -rf</code> debacle, ha!), he generally only offers advice when asked for it. And when I do, he gives it graciously and unpatronizingly.</p>
<p>I consider myself very fortunate to be able to work under his tutelage. Thanks, David!</p>
