<p>So, the search for a name continues. Thanks, everyone, for your suggestions! The Rails core team has been a huge help, too, especially Mike Clark, who has been tirelessly brainstorming with me for the last 2 days.</p>
<p>It is definitely not fun, searching through the list of registered trademarks and googling for names to see if they are taken. However, every once in a while you stumble across a gem that at least makes you smile in spite of it all.</p>
<p>Consider “kestrel”. It was one of the names I’ve been considering for the “software formerly known as SwitchTower”.</p>
<p>So I went to the <span class="caps">USPTO</span> site and began searching, only to stumble across <a href="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=76220048">this gem</a>, describing the trademark for the term “kestrel” as applied for by “KESTREL <span class="caps">TECHNOLOGIES</span>, INC.”...</p>

<p>Did they leave any stone unturned? Any loopholes they might have overlooked?</p>
<p>Take a pill, people, seriously…</p>
