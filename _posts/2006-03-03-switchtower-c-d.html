<p>Well, <a href="http://raindance.com/rndc/index.jsp">Raindance Communications, Inc.</a> has exercised their legal right and requested that I cease and desist in using their trademarked term, <span class="caps">SWITCHTOWER</span>.</p>
<p>This means the beginning of a major hassle for me and for any of you SwitchTower users out there. Iâ€™ll be working on thinking up a new name this weekend. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Hopefully early next week I can begin migrating all ST references to the new name.</p>
