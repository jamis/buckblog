  The second Capistrano tutorial session started rocky, but finished well
---

<p>So, the second Capistrano tutorial session has come and gone. It was a great session, though it started pretty rough. (I was very unprepared for some windows-related configuration issues during the first half-hour. That won’t happen again.) I appreciate everyone’s patience who participated!</p>
<p>I’m going to be quiet on the tutorial front for the next several weeks, but its not because I’ve given up on them. I’m going to be rethinking some aspects of them. I really want these to be opportunities for people to master capistrano, and while these first two tutorials have been very useful to those who attended (their words, not mine), I think they could be even better.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
