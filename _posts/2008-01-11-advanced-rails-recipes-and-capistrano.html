  Praise for "Mike Clark's Advanced Rails Recipes" book
---

<p>Mike Clark’s <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/fr_arr">Advanced Rails Recipes</a> (still in beta) is fantastic. I can’t recommend it enough. And if you’re looking for new ways to use Capistrano, you’ll find Mike’s book stocked with (at last count) 9 great deployment- and capistrano-related tips, including how to create custom maintenance pages, running multistage deployments, preserving files between deployments, responding to remote prompts, and more. You won’t be disappointed.</p>
