<p>Okay, so I’m on Typo now. I’ve got some simple redirects set up so that <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds to my old blog won’t totally crash and burn, but there’s just not an easy way to set up redirects from old articles to new articles—the URLs are too different between rublog and typo.</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ve forgotten to set up or change various things. If you notice something broken that ought not to be, please let me know about it.</p>
<p>Finally, huge <em>huge</em> kudos to <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a>. If you’re looking for top-notch hosting, definitely give these guys a look.</p>
