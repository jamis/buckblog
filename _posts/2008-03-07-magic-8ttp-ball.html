<p>My son, Britton, woke up this morning a little before 4am. As I was getting back into bed after feeding him, I saw that the clock read “4:04”, and (being the geek I am) I immediately thought “heh, 404 Sleep Not Found”.</p>
<p>He woke up a few minutes later, needing a bit of comforting (he’s definitely not usually this needy!), and when I got back into bed, the clock read “4:22”, obviously telling me that sleep was an “Unprocessable Entity”.</p>
<p>And thus the <a href="http://8ttp.jamisbuck.org">Magic 8ttp Ball</a> was born.</p>
<p>Go on! Ask it anything! It’ll give you a suitably ambiguous <span class="caps">HTTP</span> response code in return. I’ve even been told it works great on the iPhone for when you have those burning questions on-the-go.</p>
