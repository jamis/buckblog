<p>It appears that <a href="http://www.confreaks.com">Confreaks</a> has posted the video of my <a href="http://rubyconf2008.confreaks.com/recovering-from-enterprise.html">‘Recovering from Enterprise’ talk from RubyConf 2008</a>. As usual, Confreaks did a great job recording the talks at RubyConf.</p>
<p>For those who missed it, I also posted an article version of my presentation, titled <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/11/9/legos-play-doh-and-programming">Legos, Play-doh, and Programming</a>.</p>
