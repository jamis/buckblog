<p>I <strong>think</strong> I have a few too many projects going simultaneously.  My first clue was the heartburn I started to feel whenever I got an email from someone asking me how such-and-such a project was coming along.</p>
<p>The problem is, I don’t want to abandon any of the projects I’m currently working on. At least, not yet. They are either “glamorous” (meaning I’ll recieve lots of recognition for them) or “useful” (meaning I want to use the product myself when I’m done).</p>
<p>The first project on my plate (and I’ve mentioned this one before) is <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/chump-change">Chump Change</a>. This is my personal financial package that I’m writing in Ruby, and it falls into the “useful” category. Tarasine and I have talked about enforcing a budget on our spending for at least a year now, and I keep saying that I’m going to write a program to allow us to do it. Well, Chump Change is still pretty early in its development, but Adam keeps encouraging me to work on it (he’s got a <span class="caps">PFM</span> of his own that he’s working on).</p>
<p>Then there’s <a href="http://vade-mecum.sf.net">Vade Mecum</a>. I had actually decided that I was going to abandon Vade Mecum, primarly because it requires that I work on it in Windows (and not just from VMWare—I actually have to physically boot my machine into Windows, and I dislike doing that). However, Bryce Yancey (of <a href="http://www.yanceyware.com">YanCEyWare</a>) recently started looking at VM for ideas for a new version of his reader, and he’s kind of sucked me into it. It’s got me excited about the project again, and I’ve actually (re)written a few lines of C code as an attempt to jum back into parsing and rendering Plucker files. There is a fair bit of pressure involved with this project, but it falls into the “glamorous” category. {:D}</p>
<p>Another project is one that I’ve toyed with off and on and have recently begun to reconsider (again). With the change in licenses for <a href="http://www.movabletype.com">MovableType</a>, I’m thinking I’d like to write up a list of the requirements that I have for a decent blogging system, and then write it in Ruby. This appeals to me on two fronts: one, I’d get to write my own blogging system, to my own specifications, and two, it’d be a chance to write a large system in Ruby. Of course, Chump Change already offers that opportunity…</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are always my <a href="http://www.aarg.net/~minam/dungeon.cgi">D&amp;D generator utilities</a> which are in dire need of dusting and updating. Those have been around for about 3 years now, and I <em>still</em> get email and donations for them. Those definately fall into the “glamorous” category, though, since I no longer have time to so much as <em>play</em> D&amp;D anymore.</p>
<p>Then there are other side projects, which are, if not complete, then at least stable enough to not worry about right now. These include <a href="http://sqlite-ruby.rubyforge.org">SQLite/Ruby</a> and <a href="http://copland.rubyforge.org">Copland</a>, to name two.</p>
<p>And to make matters even more complicated: I’m on something of a gaming kick right now… (Look for another blog entry soonish about the various games I’ve found for Linux that are really quite fun.) Instead of doing anything productive, I waste a little time each evening (no more than an hour, really) playing any of several different computer games. That certainly doesn’t help move any of my projects along, but sometimes I just don’t <em>want</em> to work on any of them!</p>
<p>Then there are all the other distractions I suffer from: reading (I just finished reading “Shadow Puppets” and “New Spring: The Novel”, and I’m currently reading “The Final Prophecy”), Star Trek :Voyager (which we are now collecting on <span class="caps">DVD</span>), and any of the various news sites and weblogs that I like to peruse on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Too much to do, and far too little time…</p>
