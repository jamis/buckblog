<p>It’s been a busy couple of days.  A stage 1 <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> install, plus figuring out the <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sf.net">ndiswrapper</a> drivers so I can use my 802.11g wireless card in Linux… I’m sure Tarasine is glad to have all the wires and cables gone. Even I was getting tired of having two laptops littering our dining room table all weekend.</p>
<p>It seems like every time I install Linux (and especially Gentoo) I realize just how little I really understand about Linux.  I spent <em>hours</em> trying to get the wireless card working.  Before that, the machine would hang when my pcmcia driver started, and I had to scour the web for a solution (which I found, though I still don’t understand it).  And then the sound wouldn’t work, which if it weren’t for Gentoo’s excellent <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/desktop.xml">Desktop Configuration Guide</a> I would never have solved.</p>
<p>I guess it just comes down to the fact that not everyone can be an OS expert.  I’m sure that, given the time and the motivation, I could dig into the Linux source code and become a kernel-hacking OS guru, but I know myself better than that.  I’d dig into it for a couple of weeks, maybe more, maybe less, and then my interests would move elsewhere.  The important thing, to me, is that I know I can usually find the solutions to the problems I have online, and I generally can troubleshoot enough to recognized approximately where the problems lie.</p>
<p>I’ll just leave the kernel-hacking to those that are willing to make a life (or at least a career) out of it.  I’m content to tinker.</p>
<p>Still… perhaps I <em>will</em> dive into the Linux source code.  But just for a week. Or two…</p>
