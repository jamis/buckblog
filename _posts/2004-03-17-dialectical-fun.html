<p>My friend Danny Amelang pointed me to a great site: <a href="http://rinkworks.com/dialect">The Dialectizer</a>.  “What does it do?” you ask?  Ah. :) I’d hoped you would…</p>
<p>The Dialectizer, through some brilliant software wizardry, will convert any text (in English) into a dialect of English that you specify. The available dialects include “redneck”, “jive”, and “swedesh chef”, just to give you an idea of what’s possible.</p>
<p>Curious? Try <a href="http://rinkworks.com/dialect/dialectp.cgi?dialect=redneck&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fweblog.jamisbuck.org">this link</a> for a taste; it’s my blog in redneck.</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out to me, Danny!</p>
