<p>Got some fish to decorate the office. They’re sitting in a nice little 10 gallon aquarium, right here on my desk, swimming and swimming. Happily, I presume.</p>
<p>They are three little <a href="http://www.elmersaquarium.com/10tetra_flame.htm">Flame Tetras</a>, also known as Von Rio Tetras. Not exceptionally beautiful, but still fun to look at. We’ll get some more fish in a week or two, probably some Neon Tetras.</p>
