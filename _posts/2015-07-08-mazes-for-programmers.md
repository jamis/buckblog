_The book is done!_ Well, and truly. The final milestone has been reached: [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers) is now in print! Lookit, I've even got my author copies!

It's hard to believe this day has come. A huge "thank you" goes to everyone who read my [maze articles](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap) and encouraged me, years ago, to write a book about them. Thanks, also, to those who read my drafts and gave me feedback, because the book is much better because of it.

To celebrate the release of my book, I've put together a brief animation showing several of the algorithms from it. I've tried to show how playful they all can be---let me know what you think. And if you've read the book, see if you can identify the different algorithms and grids used... There are five different maze algorithms employed in the animation (not counting Dijkstra's algorithm), but the fifth one may prove difficult to identify just from the video!

Now it's your turn. Grab the book, play around with the algorithms, and see what cool things you can come up with. Whatever it is, I hope you'll share it with the world! I'd love to see what you make.
