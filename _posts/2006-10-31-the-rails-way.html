<p><a href="http://www.koziarski.net/">Michael Koziarski</a> and I have recently written a few articles dealing with best practices in Rails. After we finished high-fiving and congratulating each other on having the same brilliant idea, Michael suggested that someone ought to consider a series of articles for Rails in a similar vein to the <a href="http://www.wilshipley.com/blog/2005/07/i-will-insult-your-code.html">Pimp My Code</a> Cocoa articles by Wil Shipley.</p>
<p>“Someone.” Hmmm…</p>
<p>To make a short story even shorter, we accepted the challenge, and <a href="http://www.therailsway.com">The Rails Way</a> was born.</p>
<p>Here’s the plan. You guys have code. We have opinions on how that code should be written. If you would like to submit your code to us, we will happily dig in and blog about how we would write that code.  You can send your code anonymously if you’d prefer, but make sure you use a real email address in case we have follow up questions.</p>
<p>If you submit a full project to us, we will almost certainly not review the entire project. Instead, we’ll rifle through it and find some small portion of the project to focus on. For particularly…ummm…<em>special</em> projects, we might even write several articles, but in general you’ll only get one.</p>
<p>We’d prefer Rails code, but if you’re a real glutton for punishment, feel free to send us code in other languages and we might write about how that code would be better if it were written in Rails.</p>
<p>So, the word’s out. Any takers? Send all submissions to <a href="submissions@therailsway.com">submissions@therailsway.com</a>. Read the official announcement at <a href="http://www.therailsway.com">The Rails Way</a>.</p>
