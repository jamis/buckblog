<p>So, I’m facing something of a dilemma. Almost a crisis. I’m on a Mac, and I need a text editor.</p>
<p>Wait, I know, many of you reading this will eagerly submit <a href="http://www.macromates.com">TextMate</a> or <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">BBEdit</a> to my attention. Or even <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a>.</p>
<p>Well, I’ve been using vim, almost forever. It’s definitely my editor of choice. But I like to use gvim because I can have multiple editor windows open without having to have multiple terminals open. (Yah, I know about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>, but it’s not as nice as having multiple independent windows.) Vim on Mac works very well from a terminal-<del>but gvim is not quite as well polished. It is definitely a second</del> or third-class citizen of the <span class="caps">OSX</span> desktop, with very minimal integration with the UI. I’ve been able to work around or overlook most of the issues for a while, but things are coming to a head, and I’m aching for something that fits in more naturally.</p>
<p>So, I downloaded TextMate, which is free to play with for 30 days. I’ve been using it for about 4 days now, and it is <em>definitely</em> a step upward in the OS-integration department. A nice UI, and all that. But I am <em>really</em> missing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>split windows, so you can view multiple parts of a document simultaneously</li>
		<li>vim’s ”.” operator, so you can easily perform the last action repeatedly, without having to go through creating a macro for it</li>
		<li>the “J” command, to join the next line with the current line</li>
		<li>the syntax highlighting definition language seems somewhat weaker than vim’s. I’ll admit I’m not proficient in it, but I wasn’t able to find a way to highlight heredocs, for instance.</li>
		<li>the black-background for (at least) Ruby files is not very appealing to me. Personal preference, I’ll admit, but I couldn’t see any way to change the colors…</li>
		<li>other issues, too, but they’re probably too nitpicky to mention</li>
	</ul>
<p>Much of what I’m feeling is just “switching pains”, I know. I’d feel some of the same no matter what editor I switched to, no matter how powerful. But at this point, I would gladly pay the $50 for TextMate-<del>gladly!</del>-if it was simply Vim with the TextMate UI.</p>
<p>I’m going to continue evaluating TextMate—4 days is hardly a fair evaluation of any text editor worth its salt, especially one that has come as far as TextMate in so short a time. I know that the author of TextMate is still working hard on it, and there are lots of improvements in the works. I just had to take a moment from editing text to whine about the unfair state of my sad existence. ;)</p>
