<p>After nearly 2 years, I’m happy to announce the release of a new version of <a href="http://sqlite-ruby.rubyforge.org/sqlite3/faq.html">sqlite3-ruby</a>. This version is primarily a bug-fix release, so don’t expect lots of new goodies, but it does vastly improve the stability of the sqlite3 bindings for Ruby.</p>
<p>To install:</p>
<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">gem install sqlite3-ruby<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
</tr></table>
<p>There’s even a precompiled binary gem for you Windows users. (Boy, the world would be a lot less complicated if that OS just went away…I spent about as much time just building that Windows gem as I did applying the patches and fixing all the bugs below, but that’s a rant for another day.)</p>
<p>Two of the most significant things you should note:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The DL (pure-ruby) driver has been deprecated. I will no longer be maintaining that driver, and it will be removed altogether in a future release. Honestly, though, there is very little reason why you should be using it. It is quite buggy, mostly due to the limitations of Ruby’s DL library.</li>
		<li>The <span class="caps">SWIG</span> dependency that bit so many users before is gone. I now bundle the generated C file, so it should build fine even if you don’t have <span class="caps">SWIG</span> installed.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The list of fixed bugs, more or less in order of severity:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sylvain Joyeux submitted (a long time ago, to my great chagrin) a patch that fixed various problems with the different callbacks (busy_handler, set_authorize, and trace). If you were experiencing problems with sqlite3 crashing randomly, this might very well solve those for you.</li>
		<li>When using type translation with results that had typeless columns, an exception would be raised. This includes queries with “count(*)”, or even the pragma queries like “table_info”. No more! Queries with typeless columns are now handled safely.</li>
		<li>Prepared statements are automatically reset when you bind new variables to them. Before, the statement was not reset until it was called again, which made reusing statements problematic.</li>
		<li>Some exceptions were not being caught inside a transaction, which was causing the transaction to commit, instead of roll back. This is now fixed.</li>
		<li>Bignum values may now be bound in a prepared statement. Before, you’d get errors about “Bignum being too large for a long”.</li>
		<li>When a database cannot be created, you’ll now get more detailed error information, such as “file could not be found”. Before, the error was just a generic “the database could not be opened”.</li>
		<li>There were lots of warning messages that showed up when running ruby with the “-w” flag. Almost all of those have been fixed. (One, that I’m aware of, remains, but it is due to the <span class="caps">SWIG</span> bindings, and I’m not sure how to work around it.)</li>
	</ul>
<p>And, lastly, one (minor) new feature: Before this release, if you used named placeholders for bind variables, you had to refer to them with the colon character:</p>
<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">db.execute <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">select * from users where user_name = :user</span><span class="dl">"</span></span>,<tt>
</tt>    <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">:user</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> =&gt; <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">mrmacho</span><span class="dl">"</span></span><tt>
</tt></pre></td>
</tr></table>
<p>Now, you can leave the colon off, or even use a symbol:</p>
<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre>1<tt>
</tt>2<tt>
</tt>3<tt>
</tt>4<tt>
</tt><strong>5</strong><tt>
</tt>6<tt>
</tt>7<tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">db.execute <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">select * from users where user_name = :user</span><span class="dl">"</span></span>,<tt>
</tt>  <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">user</span><span class="dl">"</span></span> =&gt; <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">mrmacho</span><span class="dl">"</span></span><tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt><span class="c"># or</span><tt>
</tt><tt>
</tt> db.execute <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">select * from users where user_name = :user</span><span class="dl">"</span></span>,<tt>
</tt>  <span class="sy">:user</span> =&gt; <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">mrmacho</span><span class="dl">"</span></span><tt>
</tt></pre></td>
</tr></table>
<p>So, there you have it. Enjoy!</p>
