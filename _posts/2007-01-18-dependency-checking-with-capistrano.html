<p>Nathan de Vries recently <a href="http://atnan.com/2007/1/11/using-capistrano-to-check-for-deployment-dependancies">posted a neat tip</a> for using Capistrano to determine whether or not your remote machines have all your expected dependencies installed. We could have used something like this recently at work when we were having some strange issues that turned out to be due to some out-of-date dependencies on a few of our boxes. Good stuff! I love seeing the things people are doing with Capistrano.</p>
