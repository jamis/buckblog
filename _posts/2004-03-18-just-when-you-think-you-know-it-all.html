<p>Well, okay.  I don’t know it all.  I’ve known for a long time that I don’t know it all.  But <em>have</em> felt that I am pretty experienced in C.</p>
<p>Thus, it was a pleasant surprise when Mark Crowther, my supervisor, told me about a clever trick that can help reduce certain types of bugs in code.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this trick used a lot in various opensource projects, and have always wondered at the rationale behind it.</p>
<p>It has to do with accidentally performing an assignment when you meant to test an equality condition.  For example, in C, if I wanted to see if a variable equalled the number 5, I could do:</p>
<pre>
  if( variable == 5 )
     do_something();
</pre>
<p>The problem is that if you forget one of the equals signs, the comparison becomes an assignment:</p>
<pre>
  if( variable = 5 )
    do_something();
</pre>
<p>Thus, a bug is introduced since <code>variable</code> is set to 5, overwriting its original value.  Also, the condition will always be true since 5 (in C, at least) is non-zero (and all non-zero values are true).</p>
<p>The trick I learned is that if you reverse the condition, the compiler will catch the attempted assignment (since you cannot assign to a constant).  Thus:</p>
<pre>
  if( 5 == variable )
    do_something();
</pre>
<p>This does the expected thing, while:</p>
<pre>
  if( 5 = variable )
    do_something();
</pre>
<p>This will give a compile error (you can’t assign to a constant).</p>
<p>Admittedly, this won’t help you when you are comparing one variable to another, but it’s definately an improvement!</p>
