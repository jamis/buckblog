  A link is proposed between software design and choreography

<p>So, it being the Christmas season and all, I popped in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0047673/">White Christmas</a> and watched through one of my favorite song-and-dance numbers in all of cinema (“The best things happen while you’re dancing”, with Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen). And at the risk of sounding incredibly geeky and sentimental, I have to say that the enjoyment I get watching that number reflects some of the joy I feel when I’m pounding out some really beautiful code. Software design is a kind of choreography, with its implementation being (potentially) as aesthetically pleasing as any dance number.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it’s probably easier for most people to appreciate a dance number than a page or two of code. Beauty, as they say, is in the eye of the beholder…</p>
