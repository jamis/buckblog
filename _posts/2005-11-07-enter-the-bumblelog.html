<p>There have been many times recently that I’ve wanted to put up a one or two sentence post, or a link, or quote, but posting such here seemed both too trivial for this blog, as well as beyond its scope. (I’d like to keep this blog primarily programming-centric, if not entirely Ruby-centric).</p>
<p>Thus, I introduce <a href="http://bumble.jamisbuck.org">the bumblelog</a>, a new kid on the tumblelog block. It is inspired largely by the <a href="http://project.ioni.st">projectionist</a> tumblelog, so expect to see frequent quotes, thoughts, and so forth. (I’m not the shutterbug other tumbleloggers appear to be, though, so don’t expect too many photos…)</p>
