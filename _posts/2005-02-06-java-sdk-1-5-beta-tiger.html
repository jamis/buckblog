<p>Sun recently released the public beta of <em>Tiger</em>, the codename for version 1.5 of their Java programming language.  Ever since I first read about the features it will sport, I’ve been eager to try it out—Sun has put a lot of effort into removing some of the klunkiness from the language.  For example, 1.5 features <em>generics</em> (templated classes), an <em>enhanced for loop</em> (allowing you to easily iterate across collections), <em>annotations</em> (arbitrary metadata that you can attach to methods, classes, and fields), <em>autoboxing</em>, and <em>variable argument lists</em>, just to name a few improvements.</p>
<p>I finally got my hands on it yesterday and I must say, I’m very impressed.  Here’s a small sample program that simply creates a list and iterates through it.  It demonstrates both autoboxing and the enhanced for loop:</p>
<pre>
  import java.util.ArrayList;

  public class ArrayTest
  {
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
      ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();

      list.add( 5 );
      list.add( 7 );
      list.add( 15 );
      list.add( 17 );

      for( int element : list )
      {
        System.out.println( element );
      }
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>The annotation feature is pretty slick, too; here’s an example in which I define a new annotation type (called “Author”), and attach it to a method so that it can be referenced at runtime by the program:</p>
<pre>
  import java.lang.annotation.*;
  import java.lang.reflect.Method;

  @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
  @interface Author {
    String name();
    String dept() default "OIT Engineering";
  }

  public class AnnotationTest
  {
    @Author( name = "Jamis Buck" )
    public static void main( String ... args ) throws NoSuchMethodException
    {
      Method method = AnnotationTest.class.getMethod( "main", String[].class );
      Author author = method.getAnnotation( Author.class );

      System.out.println( "----------------------------" );
      System.out.println( "Author of AnnotationTest.main: " + author.name() );
      System.out.println( "             Their department: " + author.dept() );
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>I’m excited to spend more time playing with this—hopefully it’ll be quickly adopted and I can start using it “for real.”</p>
