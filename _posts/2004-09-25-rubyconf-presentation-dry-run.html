<p>The <a href="http://ruby.byu.edu"><span class="caps">BYU</span> Ruby Users Group</a> was kind enough to allow me to give my <a href="http://copland.rubyforge.org">Copland</a> presentation this evening, as practice for the up-coming <a href="http://www.rubycentral.org/conference">Ruby Conference</a>.</p>
<p>There were only four attendees, besides myself, which is about par for the course when it comes to attendance at <span class="caps">BYU RUG</span> meetings. Still, I was flattered to learn that one attendee, Jacob Fugal, is actually using Copland, and using it to write a Ruby version of my <a href="http://www.aarg.net/~minam/dungeon.cgi">Dungeon Generator</a>, no less!</p>
<p>The feedback I got was wonderful. They all felt the presentation was valuable, and had good comments to make on it. I’ll be incorporating their suggestions tonight. I actually feel like I’ll be ready to give this presentation next week!</p>
