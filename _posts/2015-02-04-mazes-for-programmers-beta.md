I've been working on this book so long that I can hardly believe the end is almost in sight. Today marks the biggest milestone yet: [*Mazes for Programmers*](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers) is out in beta and is available for purchase!

That's not to say it's done yet, though. Oh, no. This is just a *beta* book, still---unfinished, lacking a few chapters, but good enough to start getting feedback from actual readers. (Wow. *Good enough to start getting feedback from actual readers!*)

That's where you come in.

[You](/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking.html) [may](/2010/12/29/maze-generation-eller-s-algorithm.html) [already](/2011/1/3/maze-generation-kruskal-s-algorithm.html) [be](/2011/1/10/maze-generation-prim-s-algorithm.html) [familiar](/2011/1/12/maze-generation-recursive-division-algorithm.html) [with](/2011/1/17/maze-generation-aldous-broder-algorithm.html) [my](/2011/1/20/maze-generation-wilson-s-algorithm.html) [other](/2011/1/24/maze-generation-hunt-and-kill-algorithm.html) [writings](/2011/1/27/maze-generation-growing-tree-algorithm.html) [on](/2011/2/1/maze-generation-binary-tree-algorithm.html) [the](/2011/2/3/maze-generation-sidewinder-algorithm.html) [topic](/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap.html) [of](/2011/3/4/maze-generation-weave-mazes.html) [maze](/2011/3/17/maze-generation-more-weave-mazes.html) [algorithms](/2015/1/15/better-recursive-division-algorithm.html). Whether you are or not, though, the book has plenty of new material. Even the material I've written about before is presented *much* more clearly in the book. (*Ahem.* If I *do* say so myself!) I've learned a few things since writing those posts, and the book reflects that, I think.

So, are you interested in algorithms, and specifically *maze* algorithms? Want to learn how to fit mazes into arbitrary outlines, or make mazes out of circles or hex grids? Want to see how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to visualize the structure of your mazes? Want to build mazes in multiple dimensions, or on non-planar surfaces like MÃ¶bius strips? *Want to get inspired?*

Then [check it out](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers). You can even click the "Contents/extracts" tab at that link to read a few excerpts from the book, if you're on the fence.

Once you purchase it, please be sure to [join the forum](https://forums.pragprog.com/forums/380) and share your thoughts, questions, accomplishments, and creations! Also, since this is still a work in progress, you're sure to find typos, ambiguities, and even (*gasp!*) errors, so please [report those via the errata form](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbmaze/errata).

I can't wait to see what you make!
