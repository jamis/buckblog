<p>These new monitors are slick, but it would be nice to be able to take advantage of the fact that they also rotate 90 degrees… In windows there is a nice utility, provided by [<a href="http://www.nvidia.com">nVidia</a>], which allows you to rotate your display to match your monitor’s rotation.</p>
<p>No such luck in Linux.</p>
<p>The older (and I mean <em>much</em> older) nVidia drivers used to sport a “Rotate” option you could specify in the XF86Config file, but those haven’t existed since the 1541 build of the drivers (from September 2001).  Apparently no one else has ever wondered what happened to that feature, since even <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> is strangely silent on the topic.  That, or everyone else posts their rants about this using some bizarre keywords…</p>
<p>I’m hoping nVidia takes care of this soon, but they only seem to release new versions of their drivers quarterly (barring critical bugs).</p>
