<p>Two months ago, I began doing consulting work for <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals</a>. Primarily, I was working on <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a>, adding new features and fixing bugs, as requested.</p>
<p>And now, two months later, it looks like <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/001058.php">Jason and friends</a> feel that I’m a good fit. I’m going to be a Signal!</p>
<p>March 1st will be my last day at <a href="http://www.byu.edu"><span class="caps">BYU</span></a>, where I’ve worked as a programmer for the last 5 years. I’m certainly not leaving <span class="caps">BYU</span> out of any dissatisfaction there—it’s been an extraordinarily wonderful place to work, and I’ll be leaving a lot of friends I’ve made there.</p>
<p>But starting March 2nd, I’ll be working for 37signals, from home, in Ruby—definitely my definition of a “dream job”. It’ll be a great opportunity, and one that will really stretch me.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to meet Jason and Ryan (and David, although David and I met previously at the 2004 International Ruby Conference) at the Building of Basecamp workshop in Seattle a couple weeks ago. I can honestly say that I’m leaving one fantastic job for another—these are great guys.</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
