<p>Well, it was a good run; I think I’ve written at least one post every weekday since the first week in January—a first for me. I have a new respect for those bloggers who post great content, day after day. It’s hard work!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’m going to be doing some traveling late next week, and so I’ll be taking the week off from posting to this blog. Recharging my batteries, so to speak. Expect more posts (hopefully I can keep up this daily schedule!) beginning on Monday the 19th.</p>
<p>Thank-you to all of you who have written in with suggestions of things to write about. I’ll be going over those suggestions this next week, and will possibly write up one or two of them. If anyone else has ideas, please feel free to post them in the comments here.</p>
