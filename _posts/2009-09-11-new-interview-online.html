  Read the author's answers to the question "How to become a successful
  Rubyist"
---

<p>Dmitry Belitsky sent an email to prominent Rubyists with several different questions around the theme of “How to become a successful Rubyist”. He then posted their answers in interview form on <a href="http://belitsky.info/">his blog</a>. I was a bit late to get my answers submitted, but they’re there now. Essentially, my advice is to participate in open source, use moderation, and have non-virtual hobbies, but you can <a href="http://belitsky.info/freelance/jamis-buck/">read the entire interview</a> if you like.</p>
<p>Thanks, Dmitry!</p>
