<p>After nine grueling months of intensive development, Child 3.0 (code-named “Britton Edward Buck”) was deployed early this morning, at 1:55am <span class="caps">MDT</span>, in Boise, Idaho.</p>
<p>Major props to my wife, Tarasine, for all her work on this latest addition to the Buck family of products. ;)</p>
