<p>My new laptop came today… I say “my” new laptop, but it’s really one on loan to me for work.  Still, I get to use it, take it home, and… <em>install <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> linux on it</em>.</p>
<p>This evening, tomorrow, and Sunday will likely all be spent compiling and installing Gentoo.  Unlike most other Linux distributions, Gentoo is source-based, meaning you compile everything you install from it’s original source code.  That takes considerable time, but you get a system that is tailored for your specific needs.</p>
<p>It’s like buying a custom-tailored suit.  Yah, it takes a bit more planning, and it takes longer to get, but it <em>fits</em> so much better!</p>
<p>I’m actually being a particular glutton for punishment this time around-<del>I’m doing a <em>stage one</em> Gentoo installation.  What that means is that I’m not taking any shortcuts</del>-the whole shebang is being bootstrapped and compiled from the ground up.  It’ll probably spend tonight bootstrapping the compiler, and then I’ll compile the kernel tomorrow.  Lovely fun. :)</p>
<p>The new laptop is a <a href="http://www.dell4me.com">Dell</a> Latitude <span class="caps">D800</span>.  It’s got the extra-wide screen, which is kind of nice, but it’s got a non-linux-compatible wireless card.  I hear that the <a href="http://www.linuxant.com">Linuxant</a> windows-compatibility wrapper driver works pretty well, though—it lets you use the version of the driver written for Windows, in Linux.  Pretty clever.</p>
<p>Anyway.  Here’s to hoping things compile faster than usual.  <em>I want to play with my new toy!</em></p>
