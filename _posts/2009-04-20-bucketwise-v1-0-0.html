<p><a href="http://github.com/jamis/bucketwise">BucketWise</a> is now available! It’s far from “done”, but I’m labelling it “1.0.0” because giving code pre-1.0 version numbers is a coward’s game. (ha!)</p>
<p>At any rate, fork it on <a href="http://github.com/jamis/bucketwise">GitHub</a>, see what you think, and contribute back if you feel so inclined. The <a href="https://github.com/jamis/bucketwise/blob/59a056f1dd49527ff510e506e0cbf3e807b7148d/TODO"><span class="caps">TODO</span></a> includes a list of unresolved issues and features I’d like to see land someday: knock yourselves out. :)</p>
<p>Note that I’ve tried to document the <span class="caps">REST API</span> for BucketWise, too; the first draft is in <a href="https://github.com/jamis/bucketwise/blob/ef1d837287629fba7b034553472c89d76de632f9/doc/API.rdoc;">doc/API.rdoc</a> let me know if any of that is too confusing or not informative enough (I’m sure that will be the case). I’m really looking forward to seeing what people use the <span class="caps">API</span> for.</p>
<p>Note that while the source code is now available, I’m only actually hosting the application itself for myself and a few close friends. But please feel free to deploy it to your own servers, or even just run it locally. And let me know what you think! BucketWise is super opinionated, so I’m sure I’ll get some hate mail, but that’s the name of the game when you’re playing things like this on the Internet. For me, personally, BucketWise has already proved more than worth the time I’ve invested in it so far; hopefully it’ll prove useful to others as well.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
