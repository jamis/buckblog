<p>I just looked over at my 7.5-month-old daughter and saw her taking a few tentative crawling-steps toward some fuzz on the carpet. She’s been <em>so close</em> to crawling for some time now, and it’s so…amazing!...to see her finally figuring out the coordination needed to crawl.</p>
<p>I think this is one of my favorite things about fatherhood.</p>
<p>Seven months ago, Katie was a completely helpless, nearly blind, completely bald little bundle of baby fat that did little but eat, sleep, and defecate. (We loved her anyway.)</p>
<p>In those intervening seven months, she’s learned how to control her body to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>turn her head toward a sound</li>
		<li>smile (there’s nothing like a baby smiling at you!)</li>
		<li>laugh</li>
		<li>hold her head steady when being held</li>
		<li>roll over</li>
		<li>retain her balance while sitting</li>
		<li>sit up from laying down</li>
		<li>scoot around on her behind</li>
		<li>eat solids</li>
	</ol>
<p>And, most recently, crawl!</p>
<p>Then I sit back and think, “what have <em>I</em> accomplished in the last seven months?” We certainly slow down on the earth-shattering developments as we get older, don’t we?</p>
