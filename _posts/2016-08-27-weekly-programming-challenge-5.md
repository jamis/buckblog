The last four weekly challenges have gone really well, and I've learned a lot from each of them. I'm looking forward to this week's: [Priority Queues and Binary Heaps](https://medium.com/@jamis/weekly-programming-challenge-5-e7677458f646).

I think I'm going to give it a stab in [Go](https://golang.org/). I look forward to seeing what everyone else comes up with!
