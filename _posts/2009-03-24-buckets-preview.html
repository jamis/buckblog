<p>So, yeah. With <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2009/2/25/net-ssh-capistrano-and-saying-goodbye">Capistrano and friends off my plate</a>, I’ve actually found time to work on a project that has been in the works for <em>years</em> (and that’s no exaggeration, I first mentioned it in a blog post in <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2004/10/31/too-many-distractions">October 2004</a>). I’ve named it and renamed it (“Penny Pincher”, “Chump Change”, “Make Me Rich”, and “BudgetWise”) but its current incarnation is “Buckets”.</p>
<p>Buckets is a simple web-based personal finance application that I’ve been working on, written specifically for my wife and me. Its focus is on simple budgeting, and reducing debt, and It is intentionally “feature-poor”. It is loosely based on an <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/etc/cms/index.cfm?intContentID=3461">envelope budgeting strategy</a>, and while it definitely isn’t the only web-based finance app using such a strategy, it just may be the simplest.</p>
<p>I recorded a screencast demonstrating the budgeting aspect of Buckets; it’s a 5M QuickTime movie, 2:42 in length. <a href="http://buckblog.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/buckets-01.mov">Click here to view it, if you care to.</a>.</p>
<p>Buckets is still private: it has been deployed and my wife and I are using it, but that’s it. The source code is in a private repository on <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>, and the production instance of the app is currently only accessible to me. That will change eventually (maybe a couple of weeks, depending on how initial testing goes), but I want to make sure it’s actually going to be useful before I open it up.</p>
