<p><a href="http://soylentfoo.jnewland.com/">Jesse Newland</a> announced the release of <a href="http://capazon.rubyforge.org/">capazon</a> today, a Capistrano extension library to manage Amazon <span class="caps">EC2</span> instances. I love seeing the innovative ways that people are using Capistrano!</p>
<p>And, speaking of Capistrano, let me just say that I’m really, really excited about how Capistrano 2 is turning out… the code is all in the Rails repository, so brave souls may naturally follow along, but I hope to announce a beta gem in the not too distant future.</p>
