<p>The <a href="http://www.urug.org">Utah Ruby Users Group</a> held its inaugural meeting last night in Draper, Utah. We had ten people attend, most from the Provo side, but a few from <span class="caps">SLC</span>, too.</p>
<p>We had some great discussion, including a remarkably civil comparison between Python and Ruby (one of the attendees was a self-confessed Pythonista, but we let him come anyway.)</p>
<p>The next meeting is on June 22 (4th Wednesday of every month), so if you happen to be in the area weâ€™d love to have you drop by!</p>
