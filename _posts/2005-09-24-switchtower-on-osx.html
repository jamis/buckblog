<p>Some people have been reporting some problems running <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17">SwitchTower</a> on the Mac. The problem lies with the fact that, once again, Apple seems to have messed something up with their default install of Ruby.</p>
<p>If you encounter problems with SwitchTower hanging on the Mac, please try installing Ruby either manually, or using one of the port systems for <span class="caps">OSX</span> (<a href="http://www.darwinports.org">darwinports</a> or <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">fink</a>).</p>
<p>Note that if you do reinstall Ruby this way, youâ€™ll need to do a few things afterwards:</p>
<ol>
	<li>backup and then delete the ruby, irb, and ri in <code>/usr/bin</code>.</li>
		<li>reinstall any extension libs and gems (like SwitchTower and its dependencies, Net::SSH and Needle).</li>
	</ol>
