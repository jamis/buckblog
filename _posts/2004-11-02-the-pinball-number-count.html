<p>Let me just take a moment to wallow in nostalgia.</p>
<p><em>Wallow. Wallow. Wallow.</em></p>
<p>I’m sorry that you had to see that, but I just stopped by the blog of <a href="http://www.whytheluckystiff.net">whytheluckystiff</a> and discovered that he had uncovered the history of the Pinball Number Count song!</p>
<p>Yes, you heard it correctly the first time. That’s the <em>Pinball Number Count song!</em> He has both the song, <em>and the video</em>, right there on his site.</p>
<p>This is the song (and video) that I remember most vividly from my childhood TV watching days. Watching that glittering silver ball bounce through a freak-show pinball game, with the words “one-two-three-foooour-five, six-se-ven-eight-niiiiine-ten, eleven-twelve!” echoing around me.</p>
<p>Those were the days.  Thanks for taking me back, _why.</p>
