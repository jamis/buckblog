<p>I’m very pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.filmprog.com">Tyler Bird</a> has been selected to coordinate the documentation for Capistrano. I appreciate (very much!) all of you that volunteered for this.</p>
<p>Tyler has got his work cut out for him, here, but he’s eager to tackle the job, and I look forward to seeing what comes out of it. I’ll post more details as I get them; I just wanted to let everyone know that a coordinator has been selected, at last.</p>
