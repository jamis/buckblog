<p>So, I finally had a little time this weekend to try and get back into a habit I had unfortunately fallen out of—learning at least one new programming language each year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> is one language I’ve been meaning to investigate. I’ve actually tried to pick it up a few times, but it has some pretty high barriers to entry:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There are <a href="http://www.haskell.org/implementations.html">several implementations</a> available, without any good recommendations of which one to use. (I finally went and grabbed <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc"><span class="caps">GHC</span></a>, because <a href="http://abridgegame.org/darcs/">darcs</a> requires it and I wanted to give darcs a try.)</li>
		<li>
<span class="caps">GHC</span> takes <em>forever</em> to install from source. Many, many hours. If there is a <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_641.html">precompiled binary for your platform</a>, I’d highly recommend grabbing it.</li>
		<li>Until quite recently, there have been no good online tutorials for learning Haskell.  Even <a href="http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/">A Gentle Introduction to Haskell</a> is anything but. (Brian Mitchell once explained to me that it <em>is</em> gentle compared to the highly academic Haskell Report, which it supplements.)</li>
		<li>As a functional language, it is significantly different from most other languages I’ve ever used. Thus, without a good tutorial it was hard for me to wrap my brain around it.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Fortunately, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.haskell.org/~pairwise/intro/intro.html">A Haskell Tutorial for C Programmers</a>, which was <em>finally</em> what I needed to break into Haskell programming. It covers all the major bases, and gives you just enough background to go in and start reading the <em>other</em> tutorials.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m excited to start learning Haskell. I certainly doubt it’ll replace <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> as my language of preference, but it’s always good to step back and get a new perspective on the art and science of computer programming.</p>
