<p>So, next week my family and I are <a href="http://caldwellidaho.net/">moving to Idaho</a>. We load up the <a href="http://www.uhaul.com/guide/?equipment=truck24">U-Haul</a> on Tuesday (the 23rd) and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=from+provo,+ut+to+caldwell,+id&amp;om=1">drive, drive, drive</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>What this means is that I’ll be effectively incommunicado until the week after that (the 29th, or thereabouts). So if you send me an email, don’t be disappointed if it takes me a while to reply. I’ll also be temporarily unsubscribing from the various mailing lists I’m on, just to prevent my inbox from growing too quickly while I’m away.</p>
