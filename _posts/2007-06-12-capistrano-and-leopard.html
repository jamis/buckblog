<p>So, this was totally news to me, but apparently <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/technology/unix.html">Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span> Leopard will bundle Capistrano</a>. How about that! It’s probably too late for them to bundle cap2, even if I were to release it tomorrow, but at the very least this is motivating me to get things rolling again. I’ll be releasing the third (and final) preview release of Capistrano “soon”, and then the focus will be on getting the <a href="http://www.capify.org">capify.org</a> site polished enough for the final release on cap2. I’d expect to see cap2 final out late this month, or early July.</p>
<p>Someone, hold me to that!</p>
