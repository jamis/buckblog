<p><a href="http://www.therailsway.com">The Rails Way</a> is under way! Last night, Koz released the first of a series of articles reviewing the <span class="caps">GTD</span> application <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/">Tracks</a>. I’ll be releasing the next one tomorrow, and there will be two more about Tracks after that.</p>
<p>The introductory post is <a href="http://www.therailsway.com/2006/11/15/getting-things-done-with-tracks">here</a>, and Koz’s post is <a href="http://www.therailsway.com/2006/11/15/tracks-part-1">here</a>.</p>
