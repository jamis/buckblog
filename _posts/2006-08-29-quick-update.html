<p>I safely arrived in Idaho a few months ago, and am getting settled in nicely. I apologize for my extended silence—things have been crazy. That, combined with the fact that I can’t seem to keep my blog from crashing for two days running…</p>
<p>Anyway, things should calm down soon, and when they do I’ll spend some time investigating what the deal is. It may be lighttpd, it may be typo, and it may be textdrive. However, I most strongly suspect typo right now.</p>
