<p>Today, I witnessed something beautiful.</p>
<p><a href="http://onestepback.org">Jim Weirich</a> let me preview an article he wrote (and which he will shortly post on his own blog) about dependency injection in Ruby. He gives a sample implementation, which I found particularly elegant, and very “rubyish”.</p>
<p>Jim has consented to let me use his design as the basis for the “next generation” of Copland. I’m thinking I may want to just create a whole new project, since Copland’s approach to DI is significantly different than Jim’s, and the two are not exactly compatible.</p>
<p>Although…it should be possible to implement Copland <em>on top of</em> Jim’s design… something to think about, anyway.</p>
