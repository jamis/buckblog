<p>It seems like everywhere I go on the ‘Net these days, I encounter weblogs and wikis.  Guess it’s just the thing to do.  I’d hate to be considered outmoded, so here’s my very own online journal—the “BuckBlog”!</p>
<p>I’ll be posting my thoughts on various things, including programming language design, books I’m reading, programming languages I’m learning, raising kids, and so on.  I’ll try to keep the topics categorized, so if you find yourself visiting this blog often you can easily get at the stuff you really want to read.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
