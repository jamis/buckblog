<p>Now, I don’t claim to be an expert on filesystems.  That said, this time around I installed reiserfs on my root and home partitions, instead of ext3, at the recommendation of the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a> installation documentation.</p>
<p>I have been <em>so</em> impressed.</p>
<p>Whereas <ins>emerge sync</ins> used to take about 5-10 minutes to run with ext3, it now runs in about a minute.  It flies!</p>
<p>I wish I knew more about the strengths and weaknesses of the various filesystems.  Right now, it’s easy to say “I’ll never go back to ext3”, but I have to wonder if there is a time and place for it, over reiserfs.</p>
