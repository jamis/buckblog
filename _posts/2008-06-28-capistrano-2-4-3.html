<p>Capistrano 2.4.3 is now available!</p>
<blockquote>
		<p>gem install capistrano</p>
	</blockquote>
<p>This is a maintenance release. The changes since 2.4.0 include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In 2.4.0 and earlier, port settings in ssh_config files were not honored by Capistrano. 2.4.3 will now honor those settings.</li>
		<li>The capture() helper no longer raises an exception if stderr text is received, but instead emits a warning.</li>
	</ul>
