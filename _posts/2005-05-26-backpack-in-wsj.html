<p><a href="http://www.backpackit.com">Backpack</a> is featured in an article in today’s Wall Street Journal! How’s that for publicity. :)</p>
<p>Go pick up a copy. In the left-sidebar, on the front page of the Marketplace section, you’ll see an article titled “Net-Based To-Do Lists Permit Collaboration By Family, Colleagues”. That’s us!</p>
<p>It has really been amazing to watch how Backpack has caught on. We put a lot of effort and love into it, and it is quite gratifying to see people using it for <a href="http://backpackit.com/examples/">so many</a> <a href="http://123.backpackit.com/shuffle">different things</a>.</p>
