<p>Things are getting serious, now. I’m going to be co-authoring a book with Aaron Huslage, tenatively titled “Beyond Rails with SwitchTower”, to be published by Addison-Wesley. It’s the newest kid on the book-block, and (as far as I know) the first to be solely dedicated to SwitchTower.</p>
<p>Exciting stuff!</p>
