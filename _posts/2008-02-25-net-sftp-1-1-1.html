<p>Net::SFTP is a Ruby library for transferring files using the <span class="caps">SFTP</span> (Secure <span class="caps">FTP</span>) protocol over <span class="caps">SSH</span>. This is a maintenance release consisting of only two changes. First, you no longer need to explicitly call the #connect method. It is called automatically as needed. Second, this release has an explicit (RubyGems) dependency on Net::SSH versions less than 1.99.0. This should pave the way for making smoother the eventual release of Net::SSH v2 (which is not backwards compatible and would otherwise break existing installations of Net::SFTP 1.x).</p>
<p>All users of Net::SFTP are encouraged to upgrade. Using Rubygems, installation is simple:</p>
<pre><code>gem install net-sftp</code></pre>
<p>Alternate source packages (bz2 and zip) may be downloaded from the Net::SSH project page:</p>
<pre><code>http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=274&amp;release_id=19594</code></pre>
