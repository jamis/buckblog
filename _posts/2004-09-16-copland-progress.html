<p>Some months ago I released the first version of <a href="http://copland.rubyforge.org">Copland</a>, an “Inversion of Control” container for Ruby. I made a few subsequent releases, and then let it languish for a few months, until July when I submitted a proposal to present on it at the <a href="http://www.rubygarden.org/conference">International Ruby Conference</a> in October. When my presentation was accepted, I went back and looked at the code…</p>
<p>Although the job I’d done initially wasn’t bad, I could see that there was plenty of room for improvement. I could see that many areas needed a sound refactoring. So I decided to see what it would take to rewrite it.</p>
<p>It only took me about a week or two to rewrite the whole thing from scratch, and at the end of it I wound up with a much more robust, much more testable framework. I released it as Copland 0.6.0—that was about a month ago.</p>
<p>It’s now at 0.7.1, and almost ready for the “beta” label. I’ve also got a utility called “packrat” that generates nicely-formatted documentation from Copland package descriptors—you can see an example <a href="http://copland.rubyforge.org/packrat">here</a>.</p>
<p>But now that Copland is stabilizing, I have no more excuses—I <em>must</em> get to work on my RubyConf presentation. I’m more than a little nervous about it, but reworking Copland and writing packrat have given me lots of good ideas. I just need to get them all written down.</p>
