<p>Tyler Bird, the director of the Capistrano documentation effort, has begun collecting links about Capistrano, to build a centralized de.licio.us account that people can use to find cap-related info around the web. You can read more about it on the <a href="http://capify.org/2008/7/10/capistrano-links-on-del-icio-us">capify.org/news</a> site.</p>
