<p>Nathaniel’s sick today, poor kid.  They say that one of the hardest things you can experience is to see your child suffering, and I have to say there is truth in that.  Just to see Nathaniel there in bed tonight, moaning and crying—the hardest part of it is that he isn’t old enough yet to explain what it is that hurts, or is uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We gave him some infant Tylenol, which seemed to bring his fever down.  Besides the fever, the only external symptom of something wrong is his cough.  It’s probably just a cold, but with Katie being only a week-and-a-half old, we’re worried about her catching it.  We’ve scheduled an appointment with the doctor tomorrow; perhaps he can help us out.</p>
<p>Katie is a lot of fun.  She’s laying on my lap right now, sucking on her pacifier.  That has got to be one of my favorite things about babies—the pacifier.  She’ll be sucking along on it, emitting subtle “nuk-nuk” sounds, and then she’ll see something that catches her attention.  The “nuk-nuk” stops, the binkie ceases moving, and she stares for long moments at whatever it is that fascinates her.  Then, just as abruptly, she resumes, the pacifier moving rhythmically up and down, up and down…  She did it again just now!</p>
<p>Hopefully she falls asleep soon—it’s getting late, and I’m tired…</p>
