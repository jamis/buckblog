<p>It is with a great deal of excitement and anticipation that I announce the first preview release of Capistrano 2.0. This is <em>not</em> an official release, but simply the first of several attempts to get people using what will eventually be 2.0, so that we can iron out all the wrinkles. Thus, if you’re the enterprising, daring, and/or masochistic sort, I encourage you to give it a whirl:</p>
<table class="CodeRay"><tr>
  <td class="line_numbers" title="click to toggle" onclick="with (this.firstChild.style) { display = (display == '') ? 'none' : '' }"><pre><tt>
</tt></pre></td>
  <td class="code"><pre ondblclick="with (this.style) { overflow = (overflow == 'auto' || overflow == '') ? 'visible' : 'auto' }">gem install -s http://gems.rubyonrails.com capistrano</pre></td>
</tr></table>
<p>(WARNING. Capistrano 2.0 is <em>not</em> entirely backwards compatible with 1.x, so be sure to read this entire announcement before going all install happy!)</p>
<p>In addition to this preview release, I’m happy to announce the beginnings of Capistrano’s own web presence:</p>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.capify.org">http://www.capify.org</a></blockquote>
<p>There’s not much there right now, but it’ll grow quickly. Currently, the sections that might be of most interest are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upgrade guide:<br>
<a href="http://www.capify.org/upgrade">http://www.capify.org/upgrade</a></p>

<p>What’s new in Capistrano 2.0:<br>
<a href="http://www.capify.org/upgrade/whats-new">http://www.capify.org/upgrade/whats-new</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read up on those, and if you’re still feeling brave, install away! Feel free to post feedback of any kind (whether it be on Capistrano 2.0, the website, or my own personal grooming habits) to the Capistrano mailing list (http://groups.google.com/group/capistrano).</p>
