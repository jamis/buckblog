When I left [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com) back in April it was with mixed emotions and a lot of trepidation. I was walking away from the best job I'd ever had, working with some of the smartest, kindest, most generous people I'd ever known, doing some of the most exciting work I'd ever done. I mean, *who does that?* Who just walks away from their dream job?

Me, apparently. There were a lot of factors involved in the decision, but they all boiled down to this one decision, and I knew it had to be done.

Well, here I am, nine months later. I've spent the time productively, trying some crazy things, working on projects I might not have dared try otherwise, and learning some incredibly valuable lessons. (Maybe I should blog about some of them?) I'm even on my way to realizing my dream of being an *actual, published author*. Who knew?

But it's time for me to get back in the pool. I'm starting to itch for a (remote) team to work with, and a project I can work on with people I can learn from. Are you on that team? Or, if not, maybe you know of one?

If the idea intrigues you, I've put together a little anti-résumé talking about who I am and what I do: [You Should Totally Hire the Heck Out of Me](/me.html).

If you'd like to talk about ideas with me, drop me a line! I'm <a href="mailto:jamis@jamisbuck.org">jamis@jamisbuck.org</a>.

Let's see where I wind up!
