<p>Today, I attended a staff meeting, babysat my 3-year-old son, helped launch a <a href="http://everything.basecamphq.com/archives/000306.php">new feature on Basecamp</a>, registered a <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/syntax">new RubyForge project</a>, and released <a href="http://net-ssh.rubyforge.org">Net::SSH 0.9.0</a>, <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/net-ssh">Net::SFTP 0.9.0</a>, and <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/syntax">Syntax 0.5.0</a>.</p>
<p>Mostly, I just wanted to get the latest Net::SSH out the door. It fixes a bunch of nasty bugs and adds some really cool features. In fact, with this new version of Net::SSH, you can even <a href="http://net-ssh.rubyforge.org/chapter-5.html#s5">write a simple <span class="caps">SSH</span> terminal client</a> in pure Ruby.</p>
<p>I’m positive that terminal client will have all kinds of problems in Windows, but from my linux box I can use it as a drop in replacement for <code>ssh</code>, almost. It doesn’t support window resizing, and if you run vim it assumes a window size of 80×24. But more would you expect from 45 lines of Ruby code?</p>
