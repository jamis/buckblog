<p>Ah, Utah.  I woke up this morning to a beautiful day—the sky was blue, Mount Timpanogos was towering majestically and snow-capped to the north, and it appeared as though spring might truly be here despite it being only 35 degrees outside.</p>
<p>Then, I turn on the radio as I’m driving to work, and I catch the tail end of the weather report.</p>
<p><em>They’re expecting more snow this weekend.</em></p>
<p>Bah.  Humbug.</p>
