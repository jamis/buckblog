  In which our hero tearfully exits the blogosphere, though perhaps
  without quite so much drama

<p>It’s been a good run, but my thrill for blogging has ebbed. Most of my online conversation occurs on <a href="http://twitter.com/jamis">Twitter</a> these days, and my Buckblog has definitely felt the lack of attention.</p>
<p>So, it is with some sadness that I announce the end of the Buckblog. Nothing is actually going away: the articles and existing comments will all remain where they are, but I won’t be posting any more, and no more comments will be accepted on any of them. It’ll all be “read-only” from here on out.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that in coming months and years I’ll get the itch to post something that won’t fit on Twitter. I’m not sure yet how I’ll work that. Maybe I’ll create a <a href="http://www.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> account for the purpose. Or maybe I’ll just post static <span class="caps">HTML</span> pages and link them up via Twitter. I figure I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it.</p>
<p>At any rate, here’s to the future!</p>
