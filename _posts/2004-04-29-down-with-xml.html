<p>I was just reading <a href="http://howardlewisship.com/blog">Howard Lewis Ship’s Blog</a> for some updates on <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tapestry">Tapestry</a> and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/hivemind">Hivemind</a>. I almost couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw that he is thinking of ditching <span class="caps">XML</span> in favor of something that is not so “hard to type, hard to read, hard to edit” and isn’t so challenging to parse. Can you believe it? A <em>Java</em> guy calling down <span class="caps">XML</span>! Yay!</p>
<p>His article <a href="http://howardlewisship.com/blog/2004_04_01_archive.html#108300769165342372">Let’s boil the ocean: Simple Data Language</a> talks about his proposed “Simple Data Language”, which removes the brackets and is much easier on the eye. He mentions <a href="http://www.yaml.org"><span class="caps">YAML</span></a> in passing, but given that he’s already started implementing his <span class="caps">SDL</span> for Hivemind, I suspect he’s not seriously considering <span class="caps">YAML</span>. Which is unfortunate, but not unsurprising.</p>
<p>His proposed <span class="caps">SDL</span> has some advantages over <span class="caps">YAML</span>, frankly, although I think <span class="caps">YAML</span> is, in general, more expressive. I’ll be watching the progress on <span class="caps">SDL</span> closely, to see how he handles some of the limitations his proposed syntax will impose.</p>
