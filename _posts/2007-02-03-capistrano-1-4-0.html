<p>Today sees the release of Capistrano 1.4.0. Capistrano is a utility for executing commands in parallel on multiple machines, such as for automating the deployment of applications.</p>
<p>To install:</p>
<pre><code>gem install capistrano</code></pre>
<p>Version 1.4.0 fixes a few bugs, and adds a few features. The new features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A “capture” helper has been added, to make it easy to capture the stdout of a remote command and return it as a string:

	<p>result = capture(“uptime”)</p>
</li>
	</ul>
<ul>
	<li>A “get” helper has been added, to mirror the “put” command, letting you easily download files from a remote server to the local host. It will only download from the <em>first</em> server that matches the criteria for the current task. You must have Net::SFTP installed (gem install net-sftp) in order to use the “get” helper.

	<p>get ”#{current_path}/log/production.log”, “logs/production.log”</p>
</li>
	</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Support for a system-wide config file has been added. If a file exists in ”/etc/capistrano.conf”, it will be loaded immediately after the standard recipe file is loaded, and immediately before any user-specific configuration.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The fixed bugs:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There used to be issues with cap hanging when running multiple capistrano instances at the same time when using gateways. This has been fixed.</li>
		<li>The permissions tweaking in the standard recipe has been refactored into a separate task (set_permissions), which you can override if you are on a host that won’t let you set group-writable permissions.</li>
		<li>The setup task now uses umask so that intermediate directories are created with the proper permissions.</li>
		<li>Make sure the standard recipe loads first, so that .caprc and friends can oerride what it defines.</li>
		<li>cold_deploy now calls update instead of deploy, to avoid invoking the restart task.</li>
		<li>The ‘touch’ command in update_code now sets TZ to <span class="caps">UTC</span> for the duration of that command, so that asset timestamps are set correctly.</li>
		<li>An off-by-one bug in the width computation for show_tasks has been fixed.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Minor deprecations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <del>c/</del>-caprc switch has been removed, since the new load order (standard, system, user, application) makes it meaningless.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Thanks to Mark Imbriaco, Neil Wilson, and Mike Bailey for their contributions to this release.</p>
<p><strong>Update 4 Feb</strong>: Also thanks to Bojan Mihelac and Joshua Wehner for contributing patches (sorry I didn’t know your names earlier!).</p>
