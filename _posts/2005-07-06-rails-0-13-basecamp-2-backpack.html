<p>Well, after a lot of hard work by a lot of talented people, Rails 0.13 is now available. Be sure to read <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/07/06/rails-013-225-featuresfixes-in-75-days/">the massive release announcement</a> for a complete list of all the goodies packed into this release.</p>
<p>In addition to Rails, I’ve been hard at work on <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/blogging_basecamp_2.php">Basecamp 2</a>, which saw the first of many iterative releases a week and a half ago. I’ve also spent the last couple of days chasing performance problems with <a href="http://www.backpackit.com">Backpack</a> (which are now all resolved), so this has been an extremely busy couple of months!</p>
<p>My BudgetWise financial software that <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2005/01/30/taking-37signals-process-for-a-spi">I’ve</a> <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2005/02/02/step-two-paper-sketches">blogged</a> <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2005/02/20/step-three-html-mockups">about</a> <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2005/02/28/usage-scenarios-for-budgetwise">before</a> may actually see the light of day, eventually. The <a href="http://urug.org/">Utah Ruby Users Group</a> has taken it on as a group project, and we’re getting that underway this week.</p>
