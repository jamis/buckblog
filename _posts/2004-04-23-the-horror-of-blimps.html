<p>Okay. Now for something a little off the wall. I came across this while surfing the ‘Net and just had to share it.</p>
<p>Think, for a moment about how a largish toy blimp might terrorize a family. Ready? Okay. Now, go and read the story about <a href="http://www.teemings.com/extras/truelife/scylla6.html">the Horror of Blimps</a> and tell me if that isn’t one of the funniest things you’ve read in a long time.</p>
<p>Warning: it has contains some mild language, and is lacking vital punctuation in several places. Read at your own risk…</p>
