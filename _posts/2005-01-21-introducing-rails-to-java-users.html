<p>About a month ago, I gave a presentation of the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> web framework to our local <a href="http://ruby.byu.edu"><span class="caps">RUG</span></a>. Ben Galbraith, the president of the <a href="http://www.ujug.com">Utah Java User Group</a>, was also in attendence, having been persuaded by the recommendations of <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> to take a look at Ruby.</p>
<p>And now, Ben has asked me to present Rails to the <span class="caps">UJUG</span>, in February.</p>
<p>There will be 60-100 people there, so it should be a good opportunity to show people what Rails is capable of. <a href="http://www.howardlewisship.com/blog">Howard Lewis Ship</a> will be presenting after me, making me feel something like the unknown local band opening for the nationally famous one. :) I’m really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>So, now I just need to polish off my Rails presentation and practice it until I can do it blindfolded. This is really a golden opportunity to show how easy Rails is to use, as well as to point out how successful it has been commercially (<a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://www.43things.com">43 Things</a>, and <a href="http://www.tadalist.com">Tada Lists</a>, to name a few).</p>
<p>The challenge will be fitting everything I’d like to say into an hour presentation, especially since the audience will have little (if any) prior Ruby experience.</p>
<p>Should be great fun!</p>
