  content: "<p>@Jeroen, my guess is that mongrel_cluster won’t work with cap2 until
    the author of mongrel_cluster updates it. I could be wrong, so it’d be worth testing,
    but I wouldn’t get your hopes up. :)</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The good news, though, is that
    it isn’t very much work to make a cap1 extension work with cap2, generally. So
    hopefully the author of the mongrel_cluster cap extensions will be able to do
    that soon.</p>"
