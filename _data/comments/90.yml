  content: <p>Hey Jamis, I wanted to say thanks for all the work you’ve put into making
    Cap.  In addition to our small stable of Rails-based apps, we’re also deploying
    almost all of our <span class="caps">PHP</span>-based apps from a Mercurial repository.  It’s
    the deployment system I’ve always wanted but never had the time to build.</p>

    full example Capfile somewhere please? thanks. I love the railsconf tutorial,
    but didn’t see how you were connecting to your example server.</p>"

  content: "<p>Thursten, public key auth is enabled by default. If you can use the
    command-line ssh using public keys, then Capistrano should “just work” with the
    same configuration. Feel free to join the capistrano mailing list (http://groups.google.com/group/capistrano)
    and ask around if you’re having problems.</p>"

    class=\"caps\">PHP</span> projects, independent of Rails. It takes advantage of
    namespaces, meaning deployment is as easy as “cap deploy:php”</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’d
    love any feedback anybody could give me.</p>"
