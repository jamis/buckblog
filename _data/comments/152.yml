    had to support.  Adding Capistrano support made to that project my life so much
    easier as deploying updates was no longer a chore.\r\n\r\nThen I realized I could
    use Migrations on the project too, without having the actual code know anything
    about Ruby.\r\n\r\nThanks for helping me sneak Ruby into the system!"

    detailed how I did that here http://blog.craz8.com/articles/2006/09/02/deploying-wordpress-on-dreamhost-with-capistrano
    and here http://blog.craz8.com/articles/2006/09/09/wordpress-with-capistrano-and-google-sitemaps-plugin\r\n\r\nIt
    works great, once you work out the specific app issues for which files to deploy,
    and which to have shared and symlinked into place during the deployment.\r\n"

  content: "I actually had the idea to deploy PHP with Capistrano at RailsConf in
    Chicago. I didn't really have a project I was working on while I was there and
    got an email from work saying I needed to redeploy a certain project. So I decided
    to write a recipe and get cap to do my dirty work.\r\n\r\nAfter using it with
    all my current rails apps I knew I could never deploy manually again. You think
    you cringe deploying manually now? Try doing it after _cap deploy_ing all your
    new stuff."

    Debian VMs from scratch automatically and in parallel. Watching 10 machines build
    themselves in parallel is remarkably satisfying.\r\n"
