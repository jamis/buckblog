  content: <p>Thanks, Patrick, I’ll try dhclient next time and see if that does it
    for me. A static <span class="caps">MAC</span> won’t, though, because I want to
    clone the image so I can have multiple running at once. (I’m trying to mimic a
    cluster of machines for local capistrano testing and training.)</p>

  content: <p>I’m using <span class="caps">DHCP</span> and copying a Ubuntu 8.04 image
    and ran across the same problem.  Thanks for refreshing my memory on where all
    the network settings are located!  What did we do before the internet and a search
    engine to solve problems like this?</p>
