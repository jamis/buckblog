    the most prominent one of all. :( <strong>sigh</strong></p>\n\n\n\t<p>Joachim,
    why does any bug do what it does? It was a side-effect of the implementation,
    and Rails 1.2 fixes it.</p>"

    run console? I put it at the end of script/console but it didn’t seem to work.</p>"

    <p>Luke, you can put something like this at the end of your config/environment.rb file:</p>


    <pre>
    if "irb" == $0
      ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
    end
    </pre>

    your ActiveRecords logging through <span class="caps">STDOUT</span> system-wide</a>
    via your .irbrc. Noice!</p>
