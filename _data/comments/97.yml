    not any indication anywhere I could think to look for what the authoritative list
    of symbols is.</p>"

  content: "<p>Tim, the list of codes that Rails understands is in <a href=\"http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/trunk/actionpack/lib/action_controller/status_codes.rb\">action_controller/status_codes.rb</a>.
    It’s just those codes underscored and lowercased, as you said.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Also,
    you can use those same codes in tests, in assert_response. So you can say “assert_response
    :created”, etc. Probably only in edge rails, though.</p>"

    does this, and it requires that “201 Created” be used to indicate that a new resource
    has been created.</p>"
