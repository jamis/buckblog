    Happy 1.0, Jamis.

    Please consider naming your first tip as a pattern so the rest of us can easily communicate about it.

  content: 'Big suggestion: use dbi for data munging, not ActiveRecord. Using AR binds
    you to *current* state of AR, so major changes wreck havoc on migrations.'

  content: Brian, I'm not sure I follow what you mean about "current state of AR".
    I use AR for data munging all the time, and have never had any problems with it.
    I find it much more convenient than (for instance) dbi.

    I generally just do a mysqldump  pre migration, that way I can just reload it  if something borks.

    Both dumping and reloading are one line shell commands.
