  content: "<p>This is a great essay. Maybe you plan to highlight this more, but your
    examples aren’t just of language, but of teachers describing how to do something.
    The best tool I know of as a learner is to teach—especially with topics you don’t
    fully understand. This is a common technique of “awesome” people I’ve met, regardless
    of what they’re awesome at. As a teacher, answering a question well requires a
    richer focus and understanding than is necessary for a practitioner. This forces
    you to research areas in depth, and gives words to your unspoken concepts.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>For
    example, <span class=\"caps\">CFJ</span>, Haddon, and Rivers probably gained a
    deeper understanding of the string-figure language by teaching it than someone
    who just reads their works will. Not that reading, teaching or practicing is better,
    it’s just important to use as many learning tools as possible.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>An
    easy way to get started is to visit forums or sites like stackoverflow, and answer
    any questions you find challenging. This also exposes you to different uses than
    you may normally encounter, which is another great way to learn. Writing essays
    works well too ;)</p>"

  content: "<p>@Eric, thanks for pointing that out, you’re exactly right. I intend
    to touch on that some in rule #4, “know thy communities”, but it’s definitely
    relevant here, too.</p>"

  content: "<p>@mizz, thanks for finding my blog! Your solution to bind the diamonds
    to the hands works great, nicely done.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>(For those not familiar with
    mizz code, comment #4 above is an example of it. mizz has been patient with me
    as I’ve bombarded him with questions while I’ve been learning it.)</p>"

  content: <p>This post is not relevant to the article it is attached to (sorry) but
    I could <span class="caps">NOT</span>! find a generic “Contact Me” link anywhere
    on your site… I came across a vintage-2005 blogpost you made about the dearth
    of decent MacOS genealogical software and I wanted to tell you a bit about my
    current project and ask if this was still something you thought there woud be
    some interest in.  Please contact me at the email associated with this reply,
    thanks.</p>
