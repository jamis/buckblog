  content: '<p>@Joe, no online demos; it’s a pretty <span class="caps">CPU</span>-intensive
    beast at the moment. And I’ll be honest: to make the pretty pictures, you’ll need
    to wire in your own display routines. I used ChunkyPNG for the images above. The
    library includes two demos (both of which use ChunkyPNG for display), one that
    demonstrates the tricolor data, and one that draws (and solves) mazes.</p>'

    never actually did things purely test-first before. My advice is to read Kent
    Beck’s book, “Test Driven Development”. It made all the difference for me.</p>"
