  content: Got ruby working on a clean Debian sarge by self-compiling it to /usr/local
    (gems is there as well). Just be sure you have zlib-dev package installed by apt.
    Seems to work fine for now. And my debian stays ultra-clean-stable. In general
    I don't like the Linux packet manager stuff. FreeBSD ports are way better to handle.
    But... not always can we have it.
