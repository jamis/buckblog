    are seeing the problem on non-IE browsers, let me know. The specifics.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The
    hover-over-snippets trick is interesting, but I kind of find it districting, myself.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>My
    feelings on IE are well known, though, so if you <strong>are</strong> using IE,
    I’m afraid my advice to you is to switch browsers, because I won’t be expending
    any effort to support IE.</p>"

    would be faster I guess, but wouldn’t be included in core as it’s a dependency
    (and a compiled one at that). Maybe somebody should make assert_select use Hpricot
    but only if it’s installed…</p>"

  content: "<p>Yup, ok, I see the spillover happening in Safari. I’m not sure why
    it’s happening—Safari is generally better-behaved than that. I’ll see what I can
    figure out, though I can’t make any guarantees on <em>when</em> I’ll figure it
    out. :(</p>"

  content: <p>I just read about assert_select in the second edition of the <span class="caps">AWDWR</span>
    book.  I’ve yet to try it, but it seems amazing.  I’m looking forward to your
    daily coding tips.</p>

  content: "<p>Thanks for posting this Jamis, it inspired me to add support for assert_select
    and assert_tag to Watir on Rails.  More here:  http://redsquirrel.com/cgi-bin/dave/2007/01/03</p>"

  content: <p>I love the way assert_select leverages the <span class="caps">CSS</span>
    attribute selector syntax (http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#attribute-selectors).
    It is this kind of attention to detail and incorporation of prior art that makes
    developers lives that much easier. Taking this realization further, does the assert_select
    syntax support the ~= and |= operators? It would be nice if it did for completeness.</p>
