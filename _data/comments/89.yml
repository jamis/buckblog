  content: "<p>Jamis, I believe this presentation was the breakout hit of the conference.
    We received more comments about this presentation than any other. I’m glad that
    we finally have the record of this available online for those that weren’t able
    to be there.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>A huge thanks to both you and Marcel for really stepping
    up and helping us out of a jam. (Our backup speaker was also unable to make it.)
    I know I speak for many when I say I hope to see more presentations like this
    in the future. Great job!</p>"

  content: "<p>Just for them of you, who wonder if the video could be resized, I stumbled
    upon a (little bit tricky) solution:\n- Resize the &lt;object&gt; in the </p>\n<p>
    with Firebug to 1.5 of it’s original size.\n- Right click on the flash movie and
    click on the first entry (“Flash Video Player by….”)\n- You are getting to the
    site of this Flash Video Player.\n- Now just hit the Back-Button and (for me)
    the video was sized up.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I hope this helps some of you.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Great
    session, I learned a lot! But the other sessions seems to be worth a look, as
    well. Just watched the JRuby talk and after a few minutes it’s getting really
    interesting and does not stop until the last second. It’s a great win, that this
    videos are available to the public!</p>"

  content: "<p>The ConFreaks guys have been very busy getting their business up and
    the videos edited.  We have higher resolution of both the video and the screen
    capture and we have discussed plans to release a higher quality version. But it
    will take a bit of time to get all that work done.</p>"

  content: "<p>Thanks for sharing Jamis, very insightful. Inspired by this, I’ve been
    trying to massage more logic from controllers into models. One thing I find a
    common challenge, is how to handle associations when doing this. Eg. an account
    has a logo, and in my controller I’d do: </p>\n\n\n\t<pre><code>account.update_attributes(...)</code></pre>\n\n\n\t<p>And
    then in account:</p>\n\n\n\t<pre><code>def logo=(data)\n  logo = Logo.new(data)\n
    \ ...\n  unless logo.save\n    #Add logo errors to self.errors..?\n  end\nend</code></pre>\n\n\n\t<p>This
    doesn’t seem quite right for some reason. Possibly one should not handle different
    models in the same update if at all avoidable? This is probably more a “The Rails
    Way” question than an appropriate comment for your blog, I got carried away..</p>"

  content: "<p>Zing, I wonder if you’ve confused marcel with me. :) I got the impression
    from watching that I did quite a bit of chattering myself! However, given that
    we had little time to prepare and virtually no time to rehearse, I think we carried
    it off alright.</p>"
