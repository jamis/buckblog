  content: "<p>Routes were great and I can’t wait for find() !</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thank
    you so much for this unvaluable humanized-expert-documenting effort, Jamis!</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I
    started programming (only did some xhtml/css) about six months ago with ruby and
    rails (or was it rails and ruby) and these kind of in depth and easy to follow
    explanations helps me greatly.</p>"

    have learned that this is very true, for almost any kind of printed/textual material.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’ve
    been trying to write shorter and shorter articles, but I’ve failed most of the
    time. Max-300 words (how long is that?) or 5 paragraphs is very unattainable for
    me. Weird.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Even in comments!! ;-)</p>"

  content: "<p>I’d love to see this, especially since I spent a lot of time this weekend
    writing some hefty dynamic query constructors.  Of course, mine had to deal with
    joining multiple tables, but the beauty of ActiveRecord::Base.find() is how succinct
    you can make queries…ooh the suspense.</p>"
