    For now, you can work around it by changing line 856 of c:\\ruby\\lib\\ruby\\site_ruby\\1.8\\rubygems\\package.rb

  content: "<p>Remco, could you propose a regex to use? It’s hard, because (as far
    as I can tell) the known_hosts file format is not formally documented anywhere,

    very welcome :).</p>"

  content: "<p>Jamis, I believe all you need to do to reproduce the key problem is
    have an rsa key in your known_hosts file, but no dss key.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>When doing
    `cap deploy` (with svn) against a blank known_hosts file it will fail because
    svn writes an rsa key (well at least in my case it does).  However if you first
    do a `cap restart` it will write the <span class=\"caps\">DSS</span> key and then
    you are all good.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Joe’s solution above works, but you can’t read
    it because of the markup parsing (what is it anyway? Markdown?).  Basically I
    just added type to the host/ip/port list of matching criteria.  It works, but
    is it ideal?  I don’t know enough about <span class=\"caps\">SSH</span> to understand
    whether it makes sense to request the public key type you want explicitly.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>What’s
    the official word on this Jamis?  You’ve been strangely silent on the substantive
    comments here.  Is a fixed version forthcoming?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>In other bugs: a
