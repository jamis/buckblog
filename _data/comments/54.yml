  author: Jamis
  content: <p>@Jim, the :synchronous_connect variable is completely ignored in cap
    2.3, so you can remove it. It has no effect on anything, anymore. As for the “err”,
    it just means that some text was received from the server on the <span class="caps">STDERR</span>
    stream. “err” is the tag for stderr, and “out” is the tag for stdout.</p>
