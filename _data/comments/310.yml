  content: I still use your generator exclusively, but by God it's down at the moment,
    so I ended up here on a Google search to see if I could find another live copy.

  content: <p>I also use your <span class="caps">NPC</span> generator quite a lot,
    and am also sad that it is down.  Might it be coming back up in a new location,
    or is it already up in some other location?</p>

    servers. They were working fine a few weeks ago, when I last checked them. I don’t
    really have another place to host them, though.</p>"

  content: "<p>While I have used all of your generators the one I still use on a very
    regular basis is the treasure generator. I am no programmer but I figured out
    how to use Basilisk enough to add the items from a couple dozen more WotC books.
    If those files would be useful for your upcomming <strong>nudge</strong> Ruby
    version, or as add ons to your classic program please let me know.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>And
    thanks for the wonderful tools.</p>"

  content: "<p>I love your <span class=\"caps\">NPC</span> generator and i use it
    a lot (even though it is 3.0 and I use 3.5). Some things I would like to see implemented
    though is the following.\n1. Upgrade it to 3.5 rules\n2. Put it together with
    a treasure generator so that you get a complete character with treasure.\n3. If
    possible, let the treasure (like a +1 sword) show up in the statistics of the
    <span class=\"caps\">NPC</span>\n4. Also incorperate the <span class=\"caps\">NPC</span>
    generator with templates and monster advancement. This way, greating a Huge Griffon
    Zombie is only a a click away. With this updated engine I would never play the
    game without it.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Still though, thanks for a great supplement.</p>"

    by Andargor. You can see it online at http://www.aarg.net/~minam/npc2.cgi. Other
    suggestions are all great, but alas, I’m not much of a gamer these days. I’d love
    to revisit the <span class="caps">NPC</span> generator in its entirety someday,
    but other priorities keep getting int he way.</p>'
