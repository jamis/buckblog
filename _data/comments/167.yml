    Actually, I remember Nathaniel saying you could just redefine @default_test@ as an empty method:

  content: Ryan, you can definitely do that. The downside of that approach is that
    it counts as a test in the stats that are generated at the end, so even if you
    have no "real" tests, the output would show that 1 test was run. The benefit of
    the approach I described above is that if a testcase has no tests, the emitted
    statistics would show that 0 tests were run.
