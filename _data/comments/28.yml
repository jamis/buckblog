  content: '<p>Hello Christian! I’m glad to hear I’ve got you interested. :) The price:
    <span class="caps">FREE</span>! It will come with 8 figures as part of the “starter
    set”. 5 other sets will be available initially for purchase in-app, each for $0.99
    (USD), and each including 19 or 20 figures.</p>'
