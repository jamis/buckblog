  content: "<p>That looks like a really good idea. I’ve never had much luck managing
    budgets before using spreadsheets, but this approach could be quite nice.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>One
    thing that might be cool is having it pick-up previous transactions, e.g. if I
    have a bucket for gasoline and put in a transaction one week for Texaco at $25
    and assign that to the gasoline bucket. Then next time I enter a new transaction
    for Texaco it could automatically pick the last bucket used.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Recurring
    transactions would be nice too for utilities etc.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Dave, there are a lot of things I plan to implement eventually, and
    “memorized” and “recurring” transactions are two of them. There will also be some
    reporting features, and account reconciliation, etc. It’s not there yet, but I’m
    in no hurry.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>@Geoffrey, I looked at mint (and all the other options
    out there), but I am morally opposed to using any app that won’t let you use it
    unless you give it the keys to your bank account. :)</p>"

    the screencast, I remembered that I had already seen a personal finance app using
    the same term and yes, MoneyWell … http://nothirst.com/moneywell/ ... I haven’t
    used it but the terminology is quite similar. I rather use a web-based app if
    there was an <span class=\"caps\">API</span> and an iPhone app at some stage ;-)</p>"

    to get a copy of the latest incarnation, and see if it will meet my needs. I’ve
    been thinking of writing my own simple app, since none of the available options
    are to my liking. (And I want full control of my finances, so hosted apps are
    generally out of the question.)</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I like that you’ve already got a

  content: "<p>Hey Jamis, that’s great.  My personal experience is that you have to
    be really diligent about putting your expenses in the system.  The easiest way
    to do that is to import direct from the source: Quicken/CSV exports from the bank
    accounts, and assign afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I have a good start on that here:
    http://github.com/francois/family_budget</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Unfortunately, my wife
    won’t use it too much.  She still thinks it’s too complicated:  6-7 steps to get
    the raw data from the bank into the application.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Good luck though!</p>"

  content: "<p>@Jamis, I use mint.com and understand your aversion to their requirement
    that you entrust them with your account info in order to use the app. I had the
    same concerns. However, my #1 requirement for any personal finance app (and I’ve
    tried many of them) is that the app must eliminate the maintenance burden of recording
    and categorizing each transaction. With something like Quicken, the amount of
    time required to stay on top of this eventually outweighs the benefit you receive
    from the app. Mint.com does such a good job of this (by automatically retrieving
    this information from your online statements) and then accurately categorizing
    each transaction that in the end I reluctantly surrendered my account credentials
    because the value of the service they offer outweighed my hesitancy to trust them
    with my sensitive personal information.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>If Buckets could provide
    me that same benefit without requiring that I surrender my bank account credentials,
    so much the better. I’d be willing to download my statements from my bank and
    import them to Buckets. But Buckets would still need some functionality to do
    the categorization for me. The ability to create categorization rules is a good
    start (something mint.com does). Another approach would be to add some kind of
    classification engine. Bayesian classifiers tend to work pretty well for this
    kind of task. Especially where you are already categorizing each transaction manually
    – if you plug in a Bayesian classifier and leverage that manual categorization
    effort to train the classifier, then the app will (in theory) get better over
    time at predictively categorizing your transactions. I’ve toyed a bit with this
    concept using the Bishop Bayesian classifier (http://bishop.rubyforge.org/) and
    found the results to be somewhat promising.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Francois and @Kelly: Buckets will never import from bank accounts.
    That’s a feature I don’t want. I do not intend Buckets to take over the world—in
    fact, I only intend for Buckets to be used by me, but if others find it useful,
    great. However, auto-classification of transactions, bayesian filters, etc, etc…
    that’s all way, way beyond the scope of this project.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>When the source
    is available, you’re welcome to knock yourselves out on things like that.</p>"

    a lot of us could already benefit from it, and you could also get valuable contributions,

  content: "<p>@Ivan, the reason I’m holding it back still is because it’s not ready
    for release yet. I really don’t want contributions at this point, or feature suggestions.
    That’s not to say I’m waiting until the app is “done” to release it. Not at all:
    I’ve got a list of things that I feel need to be done before I can open the app
    up, but there is a long list of things I’d like to do after that, too.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>@Mark,
    it’s a shame you think it’s a shame. :) I’ve decided I’m not out to please people
    anymore—Capistrano killed me for that reason. I’m working on what I want to work
    on, and if it’s disappointing to people, so be it. <span class=\"caps\">FWIW</span>,
    I’ve tried “Quicken, Mint, and many other tools”, and was not impressed. I’m scratching
    my own itch. If those other tools work for you, great! Buckets isn’t for you,
    then. Nothing to see here!</p>"

  content: "<p>Looks like a great little app.  I like it.  I used to do something
    similar “virtually”.  I would keep a separate file (spreadsheet or whatever) to
    move “in” and “out” funds into categories.  It never really worked for me because
    it was too cumbersome.  I always thought that my online banking site should provide
    this type of functionality.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I am interested in seeing how you tackle
    the potential UI and UX challenges.  I can envision logging receipts and expenses
    getting too cumbersome for some.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I agree with your decision to not
    integrate with banks like Mint.  I have always felt that was too easy.  Making
    it slightly difficult is part of being made aware of your spending habits.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Good

    <p>That looks great. I currently use a Numbers sheet to maintain the budget. The budgeting feature is limited, but it does give soem nice charts and helps in seeing the expense trends. I really like the flexibility of splitting an expense across multiple accounts. Can I be a testing member? :)

    <p>I like it too. Especially to manage savings actually. Every month I transfer different amounts of money to a saving account for different goals: $75 for the 6-month car insurance bill, $150 for home improvement, $100 for the next vacations, and so on.
    The bank account app does not keep track of the buckets, so I do it in a spreadsheet. But an app like your proto might do a much better job!
