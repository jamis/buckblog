  content: "I am so sorry you had to go through this. However, if you're looking for
    the Zen (beyond Katie's apparent recovery) let me offer the following. \n\nMy
    daughter is just a couple of months younger than yours. She, like me, has a large
    noggin. In fact, hers measured off the charts for a while. \n\nAt one point, we
    noticed a protrusion on one side of her forehead. Early the next morning we took
    her to the doctor, who ordered us to drop everything to get her the hospital for
    a CAT scan. \n\nThat was done within 30 minutes and we were then told to go home
    and wait for the diagnosis. \n\nMy wife and I spent the entire day online, looking
    at images of the horribly mishappen heads of children with brain tumors or hydrocephally,
    and talking about the future and how to deal with her condition, and how to ensure
    it didn't affect our marriage, and how grateful we are just to have her in our
    lives, and on and on and on. \n\nAt 6:00pm the call finally came. We figured the
    problem must be grave to have taken so long to officially diagnose. \n\nThe radiologist
    broke the news: Megan's head was completely normal, just big like mine. The protrusion
    was either a bump or normal random variation.  Our daughter's brain looked uncommonly
    healthy. Nothing but good to report. \n\nWow. I've never quite looked at Megan
    the same way.\n\nI'm convinced that there should be some system of administering
    parental fire drills, wherein parents spend at least a full day believing the
    worst might be true for their child. In those 99.99% of cases where there's no
    fire, I can guarantee a much deeper appreciation for everything you do have, particularly
    time with all one's children.  \n\nIf it ever is true, you'll know a little better
    how to act, and more than anything, how to express sympathy when it's true for
    someone else. \n\nJust an idea.\n\nAnyway, I'm glad all's well with Katie.\n\nJudd"
