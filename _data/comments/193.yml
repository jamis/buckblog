  content: "<p>I think I’ve found a bug in RouteSet#generate.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The following
    code is supposed to skip routes that don’t match:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>routes.each do
    |route|\n  results = route.send(method, options, merged, expire_on)\n  return
    results if results\nend</p>\n\n\n\t<p>This works with method=:generate since Route#generate
    either returns a string or nil.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>However, Route#generate_extras and
    Route#generate_raw always return an array. The elements of this array will be
    nil if the Route doesn’t match.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’ve documented a problem this causes
    and provided a patch in http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/6300.</p>"

    this worked.  Seeing how the language enables it just gives me that much more
    respect for Ruby.</p>"
