  content: <p>Thanks for the tip. I often end up being confused by all these little
    <span class="caps">RJS</span>-templates. I believe this is much clearer, although
    a bit of a sacrifice on <span class="caps">MVC</span>.</p>

    But perhaps not. In my mind, <span class=\"caps\">RJS</span> templates are not
    “the view”—they are mini programs that define <em>how you want to manipulate the
    view</em>. And that sounds a lot more like a controller than a view, to me.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’ll
    admit, though, that’d I’d rather see individual <span class=\"caps\">RJS</span>
    template files in the view directory than in the controller directory.</p>"

    in the Opinion <span class="caps">SVN</span> repository (message board created
    by leetsoft) many months ago.</p>

    <p>Simply helpful implicitly calls dom_id on active record objects passed to the [] method so you simplify the render call to:</p>


    <pre><code>
    render(:update) { |page| page[@item].remove }
    </code></pre>

  content: "<p>Thanks, Jamis, for the posts. They’re always enlightening. To second
    your post above, I completely agree with putting <span class=\"caps\">RJS</span>
    in the controller instead of its own file—unless it’s very long, or several methods
    are sharing the same <span class=\"caps\">RJS</span> file and explicitly calling
    it, it’s just another file to keep track of.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>And since the call
    to the <span class=\"caps\">RJS</span> file doesn’t have to be explicit, it’s
    not obvious from looking at the controller whether a particular method is calling
    an <span class=\"caps\">RJS</span> file or not. So I found myself checking my
    filesystem to see if there was an <span class=\"caps\">RJS</span> file with that
    method name that was being called. So in the end, it created more work for me
    than just including the <span class=\"caps\">RJS</span> code right in the method.</p>"
