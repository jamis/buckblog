  content: John, mostly because Aaron had already been in negotiations with Addison-Wesley
    when he came to me asking if I wanted to co-author. It was definitely not because
    of any disatisfaction with the pragprogs. I certainly would love to write a book
    for them someday.

  content: Jamis - excellent work on SwitchTower. Even though it is a little tedious
    to migrate existing applications, it pays dividends when managing production-level
    sites.
