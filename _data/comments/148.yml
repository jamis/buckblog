  content: "I came across your site via Technorati.  I've immediately added it to
    my list of feeds, as I am a huge fan of the entire 37signals team and your contributions
    to the web.\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm posting is because I'm fairly new to deployment
    with Capistrano.  I believe I have everything setup correctly, but after deployment,
    my site just hangs there (it times out and FastCGI processes never start).  It
    seems as though it's an environment issue, but I can't be so sure of that.  Do
    you <a href=\"http://rpheath.com/blog/2006/09/25/deploying_with_capistrano_trying_to/\">have
    any suggestions to this problem</a>?  You can leave a comment on my site or here
    as well."

  content: Ryan, welcome! You might want to consider joining the Capistrano mailing
    list and seeing if anyone can shed any light on it there. Either go to http://groups.google.com/group/capistrano,
    or send an email to capistrano-subscribe@googlegroups.com.

    to show these codes highlited?"

  content: ArthurGeek, it's actually a feature of typo, which mephisto also implements.
    You use the typo:code tag, and specify the lang attribute for the type of the
    content. It's hard to actually demonstrate in a comment, though, because it'll
    get sucked in and interpreted!
