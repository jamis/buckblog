    Dan, I have pretty much moved to "TextMate":http://macromates.com (as mentioned "here":http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2005/10/17/rubyconf-2005), although I still use vim for quick edits, or when I'm not editing locally.

    There are still plenty of things that I miss about vim, but TM is a very nice editor and I found that once I got past the urge to navigate via @hjkl@, things went quite smoothly.

    I think Vim 7.0 will have a lot of the GUI/Textmate features you'll be looking for including tabbed graphical windows etc.

    I just heard of what 7.0 will have and I can't wait

    Hey Jamis, thanks for the advice on Vim + Ruby on your other post =].

    Alex, I can't wait till Vim 7.0 either =P.

    I really want to make the jump to Textmate.  I just got a Powerbook, probably because of all those videos of Rails.  Ah, I have the trial version, I just can't bring myself to use it.  I think I'm too attached to Vim.

    I really like GVim's appearance on OS X.  I might be the only one, I like the minimalistic style.  Here's a screenshot of my desktop:
