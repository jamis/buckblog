    Seems to be an OpenSSL issue.

    I installed via DarwinPorts, messed with symlinks and paths, reinstalled rubygems + all the gems.....and then saw Why's post about Ruby 1.8.3 being available.
    Doh!

    I promptly installed again from source, messed with symlinks and paths, reinstalled rubygems + all the gems :-)

    Both the ports and source installs fixed the switchtower problem.

    FWIW, it used to work.  I *have* deployed via Switchtower from my PB using the default ruby install.  I can only assume some update in the past while has broken it.

    go any further, I'd rather switch and use the ActiveRecord stuff.  So assuming
    I'm starting a brand new project, I do 'rails myproject'.  At the moment I start
    editing my .sql file...what should I do instead ?\r\n\r\nAlan"

    is this the error you talk about or is my install extra messed up:

    ruby(2233) malloc: *** vm_allocate(size=1409417216) failed (error code=3)
    ruby(2233) malloc: *** error: can't allocate region
    ruby(2233) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in szone_error to debug
    [update_code] transaction: rollback

  content: mikkel, that's one of the errors. There's that one, and there's one where
    it will just hang without responding. In general, if you have a problem with SwitchTower
    (or Net::SSH in general) on Mac OS, just reinstall Ruby.

    or something, I had to google to find this.

  content: Any reason I should have to do this if I'm running Switchtower through
    a Locomotive-launched terminal? I'm experiencing errors similar to these, but
    I thought it would be using Locomotive's Ruby.

  content: Alison, you may be running into a problem with your path. What does typing
    @which ruby@ into your console say? Also, which does @ruby -e 'p $LOAD_PATH.first'@
    say? Those may give some clue as to whether the console is being launched using
    locomotive's ruby, or the stock OSX ruby.

    I ran those commands and saw that indeed it was Locomotive's ruby which was being used.

    So, I investigated further to find that my SVN server's setup was the culprit. Switchtower and Shovel are now working beautifully. Thanks for your help and a great application.
