    didn't.

  content: "Mike, the migration was pretty painless, actually. The hardest part was
    whipping up my own custom theme, and that was only hard because I had to actually
    write some of my own plugins to do what I wanted (like the archive list in the
    sidebar). The migration itself was very straightforward.\r\n\r\naut0mat, naturally,
    I'm such a lemming that I only do what others are doing. ;) Seriously, though,
    I migrated because mephisto is lighter-weight, and because I could seem to keep
    typo running for more than a few days at a time without crashing."

  content: Jamis, you should be able to do the side bar on edge with {{ for month
    in section.months }}, kinda like "this":http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/mephisto/trunk/themes/default/templates/archive.liquid.

  content: "Rick, correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like section.months works
    simply by finding the earliest month and then filling an array of all months since
    then? Mine works by actually doing a single query to the DB, which tells you which
    months had posts and how many posts there were. It's less intense than asking
    the database for the count of posts for each month, esp. when you've got a sparse
    blog where not every month may have posts.\r\n\r\nAlso, I didn't know about section.months.
    :) At any rate, it was a good excercise.\r\n\r\n<table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n

    I'm going to stick with the minimal theme I've got for now. Thanks!
