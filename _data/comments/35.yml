  content: "<p>@Jonno, if you want a version that works on Heroku, you might look
    at <a href=\"http://github.com/watkyn/bucketwise/tree/master\">http://github.com/watkyn/bucketwise/tree/master</a>,
    Tony Eichelberger’s fork. He’s made a few other changes, and I don’t think he’s
    merged my latest changes, but it might give you an idea of what needs to happen
    to run it on heroku.com.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I prefer not to import bank statements
    because I prefer to manually enter them. Manually entering and categorizing transactions
    gives me the chance to review them. When transactions are blindly imported and
    automatically categorized, there is no real learning occurring.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Jamis, I totally agree with automatically importing. I don’t see any
    real difference from just using my bank’s website if I just automatically import.
    Besides, it doesn’t give me a chance to catch errors and reconciling doesn’t mean
    much in that scenario.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’m a GnuCash user, but I’ve grown tired
    of it. I’ll give this a try and if I like it, I’ll fork it and tune it better
    to my needs ;)</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Looks good though, thanks!</p>"

    importing a bank statement make the process of tagging go a <strong>lot</strong>
    faster?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I will checkout that fork. Thanks.</p>"

    code to gather some new tips and knowledge. Btw, thanks for sharing it.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>About
    the features of the application, I think it is missing few reports and charts
    about how the spendings are changing across the time which is very important to
    see what are we achieving with our personal finance program in any period of time.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Dalibor, no doubt it’s missing a lot of things. I’m implementing as
    I feel a need for features, but what I need and what you need will no doubt be
    two very different things. That’s why I put BucketWise into the public domain;
    please feel free to implement what you feel it is lacking.</p>"

  content: "<p>Thanks for sharing this, Jamis!</p>\n\n\n\t<p>What would be the smartest
    way to keep BucketWise up-to-date while using it at the same time (local installation)?
    Should I just clone the repository and pull whenever I want to update, or is there
    some task I need to run?</p>"

  content: "<p>@Ryan, if you’re just running it locally, I’d just do “git pull”, followed
    by “rake db:migrate”. Also, you’d probably also do well to do “rake git:hooks:install”
    first (only need to do that once); that way, every time you do “git pull”, the
    external dependencies will be automatically kept up-to-date, too.</p>"

  content: "<p>Jamis!  You have solved my problems and answered my dreams!  I am currently
    using a web application (neobudget.com) which costs money monthly (or yearly)
    to do <span class=\"caps\">EXACTLY</span> this type of budgeting.  This application
    will replace completely this web application and do it for free and in a way that
    I can always improve the application if I need to.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I absolutely
    love the envelope type of budgeting but it is way too much work to do manually
    or even with a spreadsheet, it is perfect for a web application.  I plan on installing
    your application on my home server as soon as possible.  I also love the credit
    card feature.</p>"

  content: "<p>Jamis – absolute stroke of brilliance. Two reasons I find this a killer
    app:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>1) multi-user: I just got it setup and deployed to my home
    server, and will be able to get my partner, and eventually the kids, entering
    purchase information. Really, a simple and awesome way to share financial information.
    As another commentor stated: “it is perfect for a web application”</p>\n\n\n\t<p>2)
    The credit card “pay now” approach. I have used Quicken in the past, which pretty
    much kept me up to date on my expenditures (not being multi-user was always an
    issue). But, the credit card account had more of an impact on total net worth
    than day to day cash / monitoring of spending habits. In Bucketwise, the simple
    act of setting the cash aside from the account the credit card will be paid from,
    is a stroke of brilliance in human behaviour modification. After having gotten
    everything setup and balanced, the bottom line is sobering, instead of the normal
    “we have lots of cash” kinda feeling.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thanks for sharing this great
    application!</p>"

  content: "<p>@Jamuraa and @Gerry, thanks for sharing what you like about BucketWise!
    I hope it continues to be helpful. Be sure and let me know where you think it
    falls short as you use it—I certainly don’t make any guarantees, but I’m definitely
    interested in hearing how it works/doesn’t work for others.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Chris, @Dave: sorry about that. There was a github bug which has since
    been fixed (but was never really explained). Makes me a little nervous that they
    can just arbitrarily “lose” an established repository, but they’re saying it won’t
    happen again. At any rate, the bucketwise repo is available again.</p>"

  content: "<p>Hey Jamis – thanks for your work; someone pointed me at Bucketwise
    and this blog post when I asked for recommendations on a personal finance management
    software that “just worked”. So I’m curious if a mobile-optimized version is at
    all in the works? It’d be a huge feature/win for me—I haven’t yet played with
    the demo site on mobile, but I will try out the current experience and let you
    know.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thanks again, I’m looking fwd to setting it up over the weekend
    and playing with it in the weeks to come!</p>"
