    to the mirrors, and you should try again later. It should all be good now, for

  content: "<p>@mark, when it’s done. :) I’ve stopped giving <span class=\"caps\">ETA</span>’s,
    because they kept passing me by. As I stated <a href=\"http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/2/16/dealing-with-project-overload\">in
    this post</a>, I’m working on it (and other projects) an hour a day, so progress
    is being made (and logged), and it will all be ready when it is ready.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>If
    you want to play with it as it stands (which is actually pretty close to being
    finished), you can check it out via subversion here: <a href=\"http://svn.jamisbuck.org/net-ssh/branches/v2\">http://svn.jamisbuck.org/net-ssh/branches/v2</a>.</p>"
