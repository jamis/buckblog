  content: "<p>Okay, this is very interesting. I have pet project I’d like to submit.
    I’m currently rewriting the project to support more features etc and it be great
    if I could get some feedback on certain parts. It’s not open source though, so
    how would we deal with that?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Jeroen</p>"

  content: "<p>Sorry should have just checked the link. So once you’ve received the
    code you’ll assume you can publish it, okay that’s fair enough of course. I’ll
    try and extract a few bits that could be reworked and send them in, rather than
    dumping the whole application.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Great idea!</p>"

    that everything can always be done better using Rails technology or you are presuming
    that whoever will be submitting the code would be a lousy programmer.</p>"
