    with the use of the render helper. It’s very sweet to be able to create new installations
    without really having to touch the server. This was heavily inspired by work done
    by members of Copenhagen.rb which have done something along the same lines.</p>"

  content: <p>Is there a way to link to your app’s stylesheet in the maintenance.rhtml
    page? I get a Capistrano error if I try to use &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag %&gt;
    and using the straight <span class="caps">HTML</span> syntax fails too, presumably
    because the Apache rewrite rules redirect all requests to maintenance.html…?</p>

  content: <p>John, the template is not evaluated using any Rails helpers, so the
    stylesheet_link_tag helper isn’t available. If you want to use an external stylesheet,
    you’ll need to use straight <span class="caps">HTML</span>, and then tweak your
    apache rewrite rules to allow stylesheets to be accessed.</p>
