    of them is good ol’ 200. How are we supposed to implement applications that consume
    it in an efficient way if we have to scrape the body text?</p>"

  content: "<p>@hatless, I tried having it actually return that status code, but some
    of them are actually interpreted by the browser as that status, with unexpected
    consequences. Imagine that! A browser understanding a status code! ;)</p>\n\n\n\t<p>On
    the other hand, though, you obviously didn’t think to try the <span class=\"caps\">XML</span>
    version:</p>\n\n\n<table class=\"CodeRay\"><tr>\n  <td title=\"click to toggle\"
    class=\"line_numbers\"><pre>1<tt>\n</tt></pre></td>\n  <td class=\"code\"><pre>curl
    -i \"http://8ttp.jamisbuck.org/answer.xml?q=Will Java ever make a comeback\"<tt>\n</tt></pre></td>\n</tr></table>\n\n\n\t<p>That
    will return a blank body with the “correct” <span class=\"caps\">HTTP</span> status
    code, and an X-Question header that echoes the original question.</p>"

  content: "<p><strong>sigh</strong></p>\n\n\n\t<p>Never mind. The <span class=\"caps\">XML</span>
    version doesn’t actually work, because lighttpd translates <span class=\"caps\">HTTP</span>
    status codes it doesn’t understand (which is most of them) to “400 Bad Request”.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Ah,
    well.</p>"

    a few different things, and PocketPC development was one of them. :)</p>"
