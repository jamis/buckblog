  content: Alex, yes, it is called SwitchTower. You can read the manual at http://manuals.rubyonrails.org/read/book/17,
    and install it via rubygems (@gem install switchtower@). If rubygems isn't an
    option, you can go to http://rubyforge.org/projects/switchtower and grab a zip
    or tgz file of it, too.

    For future reference, SwitchTower is now called Capistrano:

    gem install capistrano
