    I might be able to get something out of session; I was right.  While a bit of
    it seemed like review, there were a significant number of “aha!” moments for me
    during the tutorial.  Couple the tutorial-proper content with the more informal
    Q &amp; A session, and it was easily worth the price.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>And the real
    kicker is Jamis sent all of the participants a transcript of the Campfire session,
    after-hours haiku and all.  Good stuff and worth checking out.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thanks

  content: "<p>@Arjun, there are not yet any free versions of the sessions. I’m working
    on writing up some tutorials that are based on them, though. Watch for the first
    one (starting at the very, very beginning of using cap) to appear in the next
    few days, probably.</p>"
