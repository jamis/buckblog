    By the way, using this

    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
      :adapter =&gt; "sqlite",
      :dbfile  =&gt; ":memory:"
    )

    won't create a memory based sqlite database if you happen to have the
    full RoR environment loaded because of the following code in
    activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/sqlite_adapter.rb

      # Allow database path relative to RAILS_ROOT.
      if Object.const_defined?(:RAILS_ROOT)
        config[:dbfile] = File.expand_path(config[:dbfile], RAILS_ROOT)
      end

    I was wondering for the longest time why I was finding a ':memory:'
    file in my current working directory :)
