  content: <p>Thanks, @blinkless! The transition wasn’t very bad, actually. I’m originally
    a C programmer, and Objective-C even shares many things in common with Ruby. Learning
    Cocoa was the trickiest part, but I’ve had some experience with other event-driven
    <span class="caps">GUI</span> frameworks and many of the concepts were quite portable.</p>

    <p>Hi Jamis just downloaded your app and simply had to buy one more pack of figures.
    Can’t wait to try it out, will give you Feedback as soon as possible, thanks very much for all your effort! We are having an <span class="caps">ASFA</span> meeting soon here in Munich (anonymous string figure addicts), and I will spread the news here in Germany :-)
    Greetings and best wishes! Janine</p>
