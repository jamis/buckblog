  content: You might be able to use @reboot in your crontab to run the spawn script
    when cron starts up after a reboot.

  content: Thanks for the tip.  I was wondering why lighttpd would sometimes need
    to be manually started after a deploy.

  content: Phil, the @reboot trick works perfectly. I'd heard of that before but had
    forgotten about it. Thanks for pointing it out! (Note to other readers--that feature
    only appears to exist in vixie cron.)

    Jamis, you rock my world.

    How about sharing your switch tower recipe with us mere mortals?

    Cheers

    I made a "Rakefile":http://techno-weenie.net/svn/projects/misc/spawner/Rakefile to do some of this for you.  The config is stored in a central yaml file.

    Great tip, thanks a lot!

    koz, which ST recipe do you mean? The stuff in the article basically lets you use the default ST tasks without needing to create any custom ones--stuff like the @restart@ task should now work out of the box.

    rick, thanks for the rakefile!

    RAILS_ENV should be in the beginning of the line:

    system "RAILS_ENV=#{conf['env']} ....."

    You could make crontab like this:

    @reboot /usr/local/sbin/lighttpd -f /users/home/roeland/etc/lighttpd.conf

    @reboot /usr/local/bin/rake -f /users/home/roeland/etc/fcgi/Rakefile spawn_all

  content: 'Jakob: I fixed that.  It''s not running the command with RAILS_ENV in
    front though.  Also, deploying requires me to kill lighttpd and the FCGI and respawn. '

  content: Strange, it works fine here. The only other thing I did is adding the full
    path to apps.yml

    If anyone's interested, I fixed my stupid glitch in the "Rakefile":http://techno-weenie.net/svn/projects/misc/spawner/Rakefile.  Rather than putting the environment at the beginning, I just set it with ENV['RAILS_ENV'].

    Lighttpd goes down hard whenever I try to gracefully reload.  It seems each passing release gets worse...

    bq. "Note, however, that a reboot of the machine hosting your account will require you to run the spawn scripts for your applications again… I’m sure there’s a handy solution for that floating around somewhere, but I don’t know it offhand."

    "Here is how":http://avlooks.net/articles/2006/06/15/managing-dispatch-fcgi-processed to set up FastCGI to run as a service accessible to every Rails domain user on a shared webserver.
