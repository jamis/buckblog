  content: "<p>Hey jamis,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’m already worked on make your life more
    easy on this subject:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>http://github.com/luislavena/rake-compiler</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I
    didn’t have the time to completely implement a fix for sqlite3-ruby gem, but got
    it working and build with the project in a couple of hours.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>removed
    the swig generation from the extconf since it forces the generation of the .c
    file every time, not only on Windows.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Already forked your project,
    need to find the time to iron those details.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>On the painful note,
    let me remind you is not as easy you mention, you still need to building tools,
    the development headers and the library and headers of the gem you’re installing,
    and of course, in case of mysql as example, having mysql_config or mysql_config5
    in the path.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>With proper build process I never had all these problems
    you guys keep describing, dunno why.</p>"

  content: "<p>Janmis: I think it is a good idea, letting more platform oriented/binded
    people to do the painful job so you can focus on the ruby lib.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Luis:
    You did an amazing work with that compiler library (rubyinstaller is great too).
    I think we either need a windows build server (like the Java guys) or we should
    know exactly the build tool set available for the standard developer machines.</p>"

    Microsoft is giving every <acronym title=\"RubyGem for Perl\">CPAN</acronym> author
    access to a hosted virtual server providing all versions of windows.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>http://tech.slashdot.org/tech/08/12/06/227246.shtml</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Add
    this to their release that bundles windows development files with Perl(aka Strawberry
    Perl) and you have a great situation for proper windows modules to exist in.</p>"

  content: "<p>yaanno: rake-compiler can do cross-compilation:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Rake::ExtensionTask.new(‘sqlite3_api’)
    do |ext|\n  ext.cross_compile = true\nend</p>\n\n\n\t<p>And then you get:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>rake
    cross compile</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Add now the gem spec as second parameter, and you
    get a gem for Windows:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>rake cross native gem</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The only
    missing piece is download the headers and libs for Windows, but Jonathan Scott
    did it for DataObjects:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>http://github.com/sam/do/tree/master/do_sqlite3/Rakefile#L113-214</p>\n\n\n\t<p>No
    need to do it exactly like that, but it’s automated ;-)</p>\n\n\n\t<p>So, then
    you end no needing Windows at all, and people can stop ranting.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Then,
    we can focus in world peace…</p>"

  content: "<p>@Bork: I don’t understand why you would stoop to vicious name-calling
    at your first contact with me, but I wasn’t trolling.  I was responding to Jamis’s
    slightly more recent post about Capistrano at http://groups.google.com/group/capistrano/msg/f5213577eaeadc47
    — I would have emailed him directly, but I don’t have his email address.  He said:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>“Microsoft
    may be an 800lb gorilla, but it’s not <em>my</em> gorilla…</p>\n\n\n\t<p>“Now,
    if you’re stuck in Windows by corporate policy, you have my\nsympathy. But I’m
    still not budging on this issue. I will not break my\nback or my sanity on Windows
    troubleshooting any more.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>“On the other hand, if you’re stuck in
    Windows by choice, you don’t\neven have my sympathy. :) It is to <span class=\"caps\">YOU</span>
    that I’m speaking, directly,\nwhen I say that if you want Capistrano on Windows,
    then it’s your\nresponsibility to do something about it.”</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I think
    that’s a courageous move that is likely to win Jamis some enemies, but will make
    life better for everyone.  Hopefully he’ll apply the same policy to SQLite3-Ruby
    too.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Luis, that sounds like a neat long-term solution. I’m not entirely
    clear though: are you volunteering to build sqlite3-ruby for me, or are you suggesting
    I use rake-compiler myself to do it?</p>"

  content: "<p>Jamis, I would be more than happy to do this for you. I’m a hobbyist
    Ruby/Rails developer running Windows. The thing is that I do not know exactly
    how to do point four. If you’re not describing the process in details because
    you don’t know how it’s done on Windows, I (ahem) suggest you find someone else…

  content: "<p>@David, yeah, when I was building the windows extension for it, it
    was a painful, tedious process of making sure I had sqlite3 installed with the
    dev libraries, figuring out how to link against those libraries and the ruby libraries,
    and figuring out how to build a dll.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>All of which was (did I mention?)
    painful. :/ I don’t know the process well enough to explain it to someone, though,
    so I’ll just sit tight. Thanks, though.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Jamis: I’m not saying that I can, but neither that I can’t.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I
    have my hands full with current and new One-Click Installer for Windows, but maybe
    a 4 hours hacking at the airport this weekend can help you out.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Just
    released rake-compiler to ease the burden from me being injecting some sanity
    in several open source projects.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>If I decide move forward, fork
    it, introduce what I think are needed fixes to make the build, test and release
    process of the project easy for both sides, you will still need to officially
    merge those changes.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Even more, for me to be able to release gems
    for Windows, I’ll need to be part of the project at rubyforge, since gems at github
    cannot be released simultaneously with binaries.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>In any of the above
    cases, you will need to be more responsive, so this is a step back on your “I’m
    not taking care anymore” statement.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I know you’re doing this as
    part of your contribution or whatever, but if I invest any time, I want it to
    be respected and taken in consideration.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>With this I meant to say
    that patches, like I did for this and other projects cannot sit in a RubyForge
    ticket for 3 months getting dust.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>So, if you feel that what I propose
    is still be a burden, I don’t know what else can be done.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Luis, thanks for the clarification. I just wasn’t sure if you were
    volunteering, or merely sharing a useful tip.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>As for “patches…cannot
    sit in a Rubyforge ticket for 3 months getting dust,” why not? What harm did it
    do to wait 3 months for them to be applied? They were eventually applied, and
    a new release was made. No one was harmed. It’s not a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>But
    if that bothers you, that’s fine. You’re certainly never obligated to submit patches.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>All
    I’m asking, here, is for someone to build a binary for sqlite3-ruby trunk, so
    that I can bundle a gem and release. Once someone gets it to me, I guarantee I’ll
    have a new sqlite3-ruby release either that day, or the next.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>If
    no one steps up and volunteers in another couple of days, I’m going to just release
    the gem without a windows version pre-built. Not a big deal, except for windows
    users.</p>"

  author: Luis Lavena
  content: "<p>@Jamis, the problem with the ‘sitting 3 months in rubyforge’ is because
    I’ve seen releasing happening while these patches are needed to build the Windows
    version of these gems.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>That becomes a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Also,
    your process of building the gem is not bullet proof, which I’ll prefer a more
    agnostic approach (which I standardized in rake-compiler). So anyone, Windows
    or Linux or <span class=\"caps\">OSX</span> user can build the gem outside your
    box or mine.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Can you wait a couple of days? I’m taking a flight
    on the weekend, when I’ll be able to work on this.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>From that statement
    you can see I’m volunteering, but I’ll prefer automate the process and do it once
    than do a crappy on-the-rush release from my side.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Luis, if you’re volunteering, I’ll wait as long as necessary. As for
    the other, if I released a gem while your tickets were languishing, then that
    is indeed my fault by my my failure to check the ticket list in RubyForge prior
    to releasing.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’m not a release manager. Frankly, I suck as a release
    manager. But I do the best I can. I apologize if you were offended by my poor
    performance as a release manager. I can only say that I’ll try to do better.</p>"
