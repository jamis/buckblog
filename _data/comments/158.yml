  content: That's interesting. On the 26th of this month I'm leaving Rexburg, Idaho
    for San Antonio, Texas. (Though our U-Haul will be a good bit smaller)

  content: Moving to be closer to family? Well, good luck! Hope all goes well for
    you guys up there. Speaking of up there... I'll be in Nampa for a wedding the
    week of June 3rd. It's a nice area but I would miss the mountains (meaning having
    to drive more than 5 minutes to be in the trees).
