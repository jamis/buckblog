    Rails and other frameworks (freshmeat.net, eins.de), I was hoping he would have
    a chapter on that.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Hopefully that will be his next book!</p>"

  content: "<p>I’m curious why you advise never using a plugin one couldn’t write
    oneself.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I understand the benefits of being able to understand and
    write the plugins, but I don’t really see the cost of not being able to do so
    (assuming one just uses them rather than needing to modify them).</p>\n\n\n\t<p>And
    even those cargo-cult scallywags are at least not wasting energy reinventing the
    wheel over and over again.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Would you also argue that one should
    be capable of writing Rails itself in order to use it?  Just curious…!</p>"

    also defending the book’s refusal to deal with restful application design (given
    the book’s audience) in the Amazon.com comments :)</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Best,\nPatrick</p>"

  content: "<p>Out of curiosity, how do you feel this book compares to Agile Web Development
    with Rails?  I have that book and have worked through about half of it; I’m wondering
    what I can most helpfully recommend to other newcomers to the language/framework.</p>"

  content: "<p>Andy, a plugin is a world apart from a framework. I’d never recommend
    people know how to write the OS they are using, either. However, I can’t tell
    you how many times I’ve had people email or IM me asking me for help on some little
    glitch, only to find out it is because of some quirk in a plugin they are using.
    Plugins are not frameworks; by using plugins like black boxes, you are crippling
    yourself and setting yourself up for problems down the road.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Sarah,
    the <span class=\"caps\">BYO</span> book I reviewed above is more of a beginner’s
    book than AWDwR; it makes fewer assumptions about the reader’s experience with
    web development and programming in general. Also, AWDwR attempts to delve into
    more of the framework; the <span class=\"caps\">BYO</span> book doesn’t cover
    ActionMailer, for instance, or <code>has_many :through</code>, or <span class=\"caps\">REST</span>,
    or page caching, all of which are more advanced topics. The <span class=\"caps\">BYO</span>
    book really is targetted at helping someone brand new to web development and Ruby
    to “get their foot in the door.” AWDwR would be a good second book for such people,
    I think.</p>"

  content: "<p>Great review.  I’d have to agree with you on the plugins.  Using plugins
    (or their equivalent in other frameworks/languages) as black boxes has often left
    me burned in the past.  I have found that as learning tools they have been great!
    \ For example, I’ve learned to build effective auth systems by implementing various
    plugins and dissecting them.</p>"

  content: "<p>Hi Jamie,\nIn the internet I see two different covers of your book.
    One with a new railway and the other with an old steam engine. Are there two different
    books? Or is the content identical?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>thanks,\nALex.</p>"

    be up with the two different covers; the cover image I posted here is from the
    publisher’s website, though.</p>"
