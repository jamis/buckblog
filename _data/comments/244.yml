  content: 'Really? I found it overly dramatized, or as I told my brother: too many
    attempts at emoting moments. It seems like every 10 minutes the movie was trying
    to pull an emotional response from the audiance but failing. How many time can
    one take a long shot of smiling little girl? Too much fluff and not enough substance.
    A good rendition would have been able to make me cry for Azlan --and I admit its
    easy to make me cry. So no, I can''t say I loved it. Nonetheless the Queen was
    pretty cold and the special f/x were great.'

    Interesting that you should mention the Lord of the Rings, since Tolkein and CS Lewis (author of the Narnia books) were good friends:

    Hear, hear!

    Now read the books. (All of them; they won't take long.)

    If people are going to be lambasting the series for having religious themes I wonder why they don't get so uptight about its strong Platonist themes? IMHO those are more offensive to our "modern sensibilities".

  content: Phil, the books are great, too--I've read them all at least twice. I'm
    hoping this movie does well enough that they'll do more of the books. They stayed
    true enough to the first book that I have high hopes for the rest.

  content: I was actually worried that they would try to completely eviscerate the
    movie, excising all religious symbols from it.  The books are, after all, Christian
    parables.  Take all the Christianity away from them and there's not much left.  That
    is what makes them great, and I don't believe one must be a Christian in order
    to appreciate them.  Some of the reviews I read praised the fact that the director
    toned down the religious themes.  I wish he would have just stayed as close to
    the original stories as possible.  Glad to hear that you liked it.  I'm looking
    forward to seeing it.

  content: By the way, a good analogy for what I'm trying to say is the movie Fiddler
    on the Roof.  Many of the people who love the movie are not Jewish at all.  In
    fact, if you took out the "Jewishness" from the movie, it would be pointless.  Frequently
    trying not to offend any audience ends up not pleasing anyone either.

  content: I can tell you with a high degree of confidence that all the books will
    be made into movies. I heard a radio interview with the producer (I think) and
    he talked about how in his initial meeting with the CS Lewis estate, they (the
    estate) started by saying that no movie deal would be made that day. They walked
    out of the meeting with a deal for all 7 books.
