  content: "<p>David, point taken: thanks for doing what I ought to have done first!
    I really didn’t mean to complain about about minitest (well okay, maybe I did
    a little, two hours of lost time was a bit frustrating), mostly I just wanted
    to “raise awareness” of the anti-pattern. But my point would have been stronger
    if I’d included a patch. Thanks for fixing that for me. ;)</p>"

    off, not using them at all? :P</p>"

    <p>Ehm, I am very sorry about the OT but I can’t find a proper section to post this message in your blog…
    Due to an hardware failure in my computer, I lost your wonderful dungeon generator program.
    The web page to download it seems to be broken.
    I have seen that your dungeon generator is nicely implemented in another website, but I would like to have an off-site version to carry around with my laptop.
    There is any place where can I download your dungeon generator?
    I would be happy even with the old third edition version…
    Thank you very much</p>
