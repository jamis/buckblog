  content: "<p>Great stuff, thanks!</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’ve got a combination of two features
    there causing me a wee problem.  In order for Subversion to prompt you for a password,
    it needs a pty.  I seem to have kicked it into working by changing line 29 of
    lib/capistrano/recipes/deploy/strategy/remote.rb to:</p>\n\n\n\t<pre><code>run(command,
    :pty =&gt; true) do |ch,stream,text|</code></pre>\n\n\n\t<p>ie just passing in
    `:pty =&gt; true` to the run command just in case it needs a pty.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I
    guess that’s going to screw up people that don’t have their scm command on their
    path and are relying on a bashrc to set it up.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>And yeah, you are
    looking at Solaris for the sudo-equivalent without a `<del>p`.  On the plus side,
    it’s called `pfexec` and doesn’t (at least not any way I’ve figured of configuring
    it!) ever prompt for a password.  My deploy has just failed because of it, so
    I’m sure I’ll have something more to say shortly. :</del>)</p>"

  content: "<p>Aha, on line 73 of lib/capistrano/configuration/actions/invocation.rb,
    I’ve changed it to the following:</p>\n\n\n\t<pre><code>command = [fetch(:sudo,
    \"sudo\"), fetch(:sudo_args, \"-p '#{sudo_prompt}' #{user}\"), command].compact.join(\"
    \")</code></pre>\n\n\n\t<p>That way, I can do:</p>\n\n\n\t<pre><code>set :sudo_args,
    nil</code></pre>\n\n\n\t<p>while everybody else in the world ever can remain happy
    as they are. :-)</p>"

  content: "<p>@Graeme, ugh, that’s nasty (on both counts). Perhaps I’ll just put
    the—password switch back for subversion. As for sudo…gah. I’m so sick of solaris
    doing it’s own thing. Perhaps I’ll tweak so that if sudo_prompt is false it does
    as you suggested (to avoid adding yet another setting).</p>"

  content: <p>To be fair, Solaris can have `sudo` installed too.  However, they have
    a full <span class="caps">RBAC</span> implementation (something I think SELinux
    aspires to?) which does so much more than sudo is capable of, and I have a preference
    for using the built-in tools as much as possible.  I’ve only scratched the surface
    of its capabilities, but the Solaris <span class="caps">RBAC</span> system is
    incredibly good.</p>
