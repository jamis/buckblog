  content: <p>Though installing <span class="caps">SWIG</span> is a good learning
    experience, I’m glad the dependency is gone.  One less hurdle to convince coworkers
    to use SQLite.  Thanks so much for your work on this library!</p>

  content: "<p>Good work, thanks for the hard work on the blog, definitely one of
    the best around.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I have an sqlite3 related question – I’m using
    it in my test environment, but have noticed that it’s not defaulting model attributes
    to nil, instead setting them to 0, despite no default being set in the database
    and allow null enabled. Any ideas why this might be?</p>"

  content: "<p>Jamis,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thanks for the bug fixes!</p>\n\n\n\t<p>One thing
    I was hoping to see fixed-<del>and I don’t know if it’s a sqlite3-ruby isssue
    or just the AR adapter</del>-is the obscure error messages.  MySQL gives a helpful
    error message that says what problem was (or at least if it was an error with
    the <span class=\"caps\">SQL</span> statement, a field doesn’t exist, etc.).  Is
    this a something that can be fixed, or is it just an sqlite issue?</p>"

  content: "<p>Teken, it’s probably something in the Rails adapter for sqlite3, and
    not in the sqlite3 bindings. Please do investigate and see what you can find.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Brandon,
    I’m not sure what you mean. Can you give an example?</p>"

  content: <p>I also had a significant problem with sqlite3 in test environment. It
    was converting my blank strings (as in ’’) into two quotes (as in ”’’”). It was
    doing this on <span class="caps">OSX</span> and windows on both ruby 1.8.4 and
    1.8.5, so I’m guessing it’s a rails problem. Unfortunately I couldn’t find anymore
    info about it.</p>

  content: "<p>Jamis,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Here’s an example. If I have a mis-named fixture
    when I run my tests, mysql raises this helpful error:</p>\n\n\n<pre>\nActiveRecord::StatementInvalid:
    Mysql::Error: Unknown column 'first_nam' in 'field list': INSERT INTO users (`first_nam`,
    `id`) VALUES ('Joe', 11)\n</pre>\n\n\t<p>Where as, sqlite raises this:</p>\n\n\n<pre>\n/opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/sqlite3-ruby-1.2.0/lib/sqlite3/errors.rb:94:in
    `check': SQL logic error or missing database (SQLite3::SQLException)\n</pre>\n\n\t<p>I
    like to use sqlite when developing locally, but this bites me every time and usually
    forces me to switch to mysql.</p>"

  content: "<p>Brandon, I can’t duplicate that second error using the sqlite3 adapter
    with ActiveRecord. It’s probably a Rails issue, though, so if you post detailed
    steps to reproducing the problem on the Rails bugtracker, there’s a better chance
    of it getting fixed, or at least addressed.</p>"
