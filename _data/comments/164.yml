    I agree with TIm. There should be no need for you to change the name of Switchtower. Unless their switchtower product has anything todo with deployment and change management these are completely different products. IANAL but as far as I understand US trademark law does not allow you to keep others from using your name in some completely unrelated product.

    I say keep it Switchtower.

  content: "IANAL either, but I think Pelle may be right. Consult with a lawyer or
    at least ask the people at groklaw or eff, if you want to keep the name.\n\nLooks
    like Raindance makes a suite of network appliances for web conferencing which
    when used together constitute what they call a SwitchTower network. This is not
    competition with a development tool (completely different markets) but since they're
    both \"computer stuff\" it would pay to check with a lawyer. \n\nThis boils down
    to they aren't showing up on the first page of a google search for switchtower
    and that makes them mad. It's easy to send out a cease and desist letter and scare
    some open source developers into changing a name. I say stand your ground until
    it actually comes down to spending money to do so (e.g. paying a lawyer or going
    to court).\n\nOr just change the name. I never really liked it anyway (but don't
    change it on my account!)."

    I hope whatever you choose you avoid the tired railroad metaphors.  It getting really annoying.  And the metaphor doesn't always work.

    If anything, ST has a cooking metaphor going with its "recipes".  Maybe a kitchen/cooking/baking theme would work.  How about "Baker" or "Chef" or "ActiveCook" or something?

    Hell, call it ActiveMicrowave since it takes the effort out of cooking up a production app :)

    Jamis--hope you can fight this. It smells of bullying, and that happens far too often in this country.

    If you are forced to back down, you could always do a recursive GNU-ish thing. I'm thinking SOWS, meaning "SOWS Once Was SwitchTower". The beauty of recursion means you can make the first letter anything you like if you think of something more fitting.

    I appreciate the moral support, all, but we have consulted a lawyer and their advice was that we not try to fight this. The point is that both the deployment software "SwitchTower", and Raindance's software, are both software, which is similar enough, apparently.

    So, we're definitely renaming. We'd like to choose a name unrelated to railroad terminology, simply because ST is not rails specific and we'd like to emphasize that a bit.

    Great suggestions so far, btw. Thanks, all!

    If Jim Weirich doesn't mind, you could call it Distributed Rake/DRake/Drake.

    If you want to give raindance a bittersweet victory, you could do something like: Used To Be SwitchTower, and abbreviate it U2B SwitchTower. That would get past the naming issue (I assume) and still keep you at the top of google searches for SwitchTower.

    JB &amp; Company's SwitchTower

    X-SwitchTower

    Switched Tower (due to legal threats (tm))



    My sympathies go out to you, just hope that you can include "formerly SwitchTower" if you go back and replace all recurring instances with a new name.

    Well, it is sad that you are being forced to change your name... IP laws are teh suck.

    But, you may as well make the most of it while you can. Since you aren't really going for a railroad related name, you can go for some similar terms. For instance, SwitchTower is all about coordinating releases, upgrades, and maintenance. So how about Conductor or Orchestrator? It makes sense since we use your program to guide all of the code into place and get everything ready.

    Now if you could just get it to direct in 3/4 time rather than in 4/4 time it might even be considered a SuperConductor!
