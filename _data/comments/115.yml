    take on a leading role in this, but if someone does create a structure of “what
    chunks need to be documented” I’d be happy to contribute!</p>\n\n\n\t<p>If someone

    About the same amount of documentation, but about 1/10th as much stuff to document.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>What
    ever happened to that rails deployment book?</p>"

    documentation for open source can’t be a real experience and it won’t let you

  content: "<p>@Garry, that was a low blow, slinging my own words back at me. :) But
    valid.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>@Yaroslav, money only takes you so far. When the limiting
    factor is time, no amount of money is going to solve the problem. I’m hoping that
    by delegating the documentation effort to the community, the time constraint will
    go away and things will start happening.</p>"

  content: "<p>I’m pessimistic about this, though I wish you luck.  One problem is
    that, while there’s glory in code, <strong>there’s no glory in documentation</strong>.
    \ At events like RailsConf, people see you and say “Holy crap, there’s Jamis Buck,
    the guy who wrote Capistrano!” (and then subscribe to your blog).  Your best bet
    is to find a way to reward documenters with some reflected glory, so that people
    might also say “Holy crap, there’s Joe Blow, the guy who wrote that awesome Capistrano
    documentation!” (and then subscribe to his blog).  Until that happens, expect
    most open-source documentation to continue to suck.</p>"

    hope for the best. And of course I’ll do everything I can to reflect “glory” (if
    you can call it that—it feels more like an immense pressure to perform) to everyone
    who contributes.</p>"

    I did my rails applications I used Rake, but I can figure out Capistrano and have
    written documentation before (although mostly code). Email me if the task has

  content: <p>@Mark, if you’re interested in taking a peek, I can post the repository
    <span class="caps">URL</span>’s again (they’ve been posted here before, but I
    can’t remember them off the top of my head). I’d welcome patches, but to be honest,
    about all that’s left is writing tests and documentation, and I’m slogging through
    that now. Maybe a release by the end of January?</p>
