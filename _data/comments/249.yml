  content: Wow! Thanks. I've been neglecting doing this myself as I've been using
    S.E.E. for all my Haskell hacking but this is a step in the right direction.

  content: "Hi Jamis,\r\n\r\nI think I'll learn Haskell too, at least when I can think
    of an interesting project to hack with it :) The tutorial you pointed to in your
    previous post was helpful, thanks!\r\n\r\nThere is a list of wanted bundles on
    \"TextMate's wiki\":http://macromates.com/wiki/pmwiki?n=Main.Bundles, maybe you
    can submit your bundle for inclusion in the repository?"

  content: Jamis that's brilliant.  I took a first look at Haskell last night and
    immediatelly wondered where the TextMate support was ;-)

  content: For windows, Ultra-Edit has support for Haskel code, haven't tried it though.
    You'll find it on "wordfile" page. http://ultraedit.com/ if interested.

  content: I don't have a windows machine but I hear the is a plugin for Visual Studio
    for Haskell that is really nice. TextMate (thanks to Jamis) and SubEthaEdit both
    do Haskell on OS X. Standard *nix editors like Vim and Emacs support Haskell (these
    work on windows and OS X too). There is preliminary work on a new tool called
    hIDE. It is still young but keep your eyes open for that one if you use Haskell
    at all.

  content: "Thank you!! My most wanted plug-in!\nI was thinking of doing the Haskell
    bundle for Textmate, mas it is quite hard, so I gived up.\nThank you. "
