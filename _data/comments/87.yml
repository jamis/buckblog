  content: "<p>Love the new cap, Jamis – thanks!</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’m using it to automate
    sysadmin tasks for a few Ubuntu 7.04 and Debian Etch servers.  Got stuck because
    “cap deploy” kept bombing when I ran it on my Debian Etch administration server.
    \ Finally figured it out:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>On the deploying host, capistrano’s “deploy”
    needs to be able to execute</p>\n\n\n\t<pre><code>\"svn info -r\"</code></pre>\n\n\n\t<p>Debian
    Etch’s version of Subversion is 1.1.x – too old for “-r” on svn info. Dash r appeared
    in subversion 1.2.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>So, that seems like a dependency that folks on
    Debian Etch or older will run into.</p>"

    that fix (or a similar one) will find its way into RubyGems itself eventually.</p>"
