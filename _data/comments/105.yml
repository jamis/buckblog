  content: "<p>thanks Jamis,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I use Capistrano but really can’t find
    a good or easy documentation besides the one on the rails manual (book 17) which
    I don’t know if it gets updated.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Any help with this? like for example,
    how to manage capistrano with sqlite projects? a good recipe to move/copy the
    sqlite to the ‘shared’ folder after deploy?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>sorry, It might be just
    me</p>"

  content: "<p>mano, sadly, documentation is very, very lacking with Capistrano right
    now. I no longer have access to the rails manuals and so cannot update that book.
    I’m working on other documentation options, but my plate is very, very full at
    the moment.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Note, though, that capistrano+sqlite is beyond the scope
    of any manual I would write; it’s far too specific. Please feel free to join the
    Capistrano mailing list at <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/capistrano\">Google
    groups</a>. There are a lot of people there who would be more than willing to
    share advice on many different usage scenarios.</p>"
