    me at the email provided with this comment if you are interesting in providing
    a conference bridge for all your attendees to talk on.  The call recording would
    likely be the perfect companion for those looking for the transcripts due to missing
    the event.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>ie) The date does not work for me but would love to see/hear
    what transpires :)</p>"
