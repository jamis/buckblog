  content: Just out of curiousity... why are you stuck with 1.3?

  content: Mostly because the server in question is not part of a redundant set of
    web servers, and we can't afford to take it down to move everything to apache
    2 just yet. We'll get some redundancy in there soon, and then we'll move to apache
    2.

  content: "Any reason why you're not using 'render :nothing =&gt; true' to stop rendering?\r\nSeems
    a bit more like normal renders that way... although I suspect that will do just
    what you did with @performed_render ;-)"

  content: If I were to use @render :nothing =&gt; true@, it would clobber anything
    that was rendered by the other controller. The @SslProxyController@ has no knowledge
    of what occurs in the new controller, and vice versa. The best I can do is "trick"
    the @SslProxyController@ into thinking something has been rendered, and I do that
    by setting that instance variable.
