  content: "<p>Jamis,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Your articles are fabulous and we need more of
    them from the Rails ‘old guard’ – who all seem to have disappeared off doing things
    for money nowadays.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>However you might want to consider an index
    page before too long. Blogs are all very well, but good stuff gets lost in them
    over time.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Rgs</p>\n\n\n\t<p>NeilW</p>"
