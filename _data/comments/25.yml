    I’ve tested it on a 3.1.3 device, where it worked fine. I submitted it to the
    app store last night, and the wait is supposed to be around a week…so sometime
    late next week we’ll see whether Apple likes the idea or not. :) Once it’s approved,
    I’d love to hear what you think of the app!</p>"
