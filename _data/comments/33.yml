  content: "<p>This is awesome Jamis. Thanks for posting these detailed notes on your
    talk. I’ll enjoy referring to them in the future. And thanks for being awesome
    enough to go to lunch with a complete stranger at the conference when probably
    everyone there wanted a chance to hang out with the keynote speaker!</p>"

  content: "<p>Wonderful opening paragraph under the “Being Awesome” headline.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I
    get very much of this dismissive “magic” attitude being a yogi (doing “Sahaja
    Yoga” meditation every day for a couple of years). The eastern knowledge of our
    subtle body with its energy centers (chakras) and energy channels (nadis) can
    be experienced by any one who gives a little effort into practicing meditation
    and quickly has tremendous effects on physical, psychological and spiritual well
    being.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>However when non meditators (especially the fanatic atheist
    kind) ask questions about it and you explain something that is very real and affects
    every human being on the planet. It’s all a bit too “exceptional”. And a kind
    of dismissive attitude in the collective mind evolves that people latch onto to
    excuse themselves. Without having to feel bad about not researching the new knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thanks
    for bringing attention to the potential awesomeness of every individual :)</p>"

  content: "<p>This is very interesting. I have read Honor Maude’s book on Nauruan
    String figures but I did not know she was influenced by Carolyn Jayne Furness.
    I will no look for Furness’book and read that as well.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The Nauruan
    figures have been framed after being made on the hand and some of them hang in
    public places and private homes</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thanks for the enlightment</p>"

  content: "<p>I’ve recently been learning Drupal and I’ve been feeling like there
    was a lot of magic involved. But I strongly believe that you’re right, that there
    is no magic, only awesomeness that I need to learn about. Thank you for the continual
    inspiration!</p>"

  content: "<p>Very interesting, especially the Biblical allusion of “know thy …”
    not a very empirical process to be sure!  If I read this correctly, you are proposing
    that we achieve ‘knowledge’ that leads to awesomeness primarily through commitment,
    experience and relationship/community.  Assuming I have this correct, this is
    a most welcome proposition!</p>"
