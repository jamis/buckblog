    repository to install gems from.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>For instance, if I asked for the
    gem “jamis-fuzzyfinder_textmate” it would always install yours. And if I asked
    for simply “fuzzyfinder_textmate” it would point to yours. But if someone stepped
    up and took over your project, you’d have the option of passing the baton (maybe
    they could even call it a ‘baton’, I don’t know what name it should have).</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Then
    a “gem install fuzzyfinder_textmate” would find the one maintained by the new
    person you passed the baton to.</p>"

  content: "<p>Niels, thanks.  I have also just confirmed that no version of fuzzyfinder.vim
    after 2.16 works with the version of fuzzyfinder_textmate.vim that I downloaded
    from github today.  Thinking about it a little more, that probably should have
    been the obvious first guess from the release/commit history of the two files
    respectively.</p>"

  content: "<p>Also to go along with that version note, although FuzzyFinder is listed
    as a vim 7.0 script on vim.org it actually needs 7.1 from 2.0 onward.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thanks
    for the script Jamis sure someone will give it a good home.</p>"

  content: "<p>FuzzyFinder has a bug when works TagList plugin (it open the file in
    taglist, very annoying). It’s solved in fuzzyfinder 2.16 changing the line 1483:</p>\n\n\n\t<pre><code>wincmd
    p</code></pre>\n\n\n\t<p>to:</p>\n\n\n\t<pre><code>wincmd j</code></pre>\n\n\n\t<p>Then
    the next time that you open a file it’ll open in correct window.</p>"

    avoids the problem. Thanks for the Stephen Bach, author of lusty-explorer, for
    this info.</p>"
