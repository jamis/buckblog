    Thanks for the update- love to hear more. Always good to hear about Rails progress, also.

    The grammar geek in me requires me to express my outrage at your inappropriate use of apostrophes. "Mac laptop's everywhere"-- this "apostrophe as plural" is spreading everywhere. It must be stopped on all fronts!

    I never really had much trouble switching to TextMate simply because when it comes to text editors, I don't do anything fancy.  I like having the option to, but I just never make use of it.

    The fanciest feature I use in TextMate is the two-space tabs that are really actually two spaces.  And yeah, other than that, I just type.

    Given that, unsurprisingly, my previous editor of choice was emacs.

    Thanks for the tip on Textmate. I just downloaded it and it seems rather nice. I'm a vim buff myself. Old school UNIX user who converted to Mac when I saw there was finally UNIX with commercial apps and a nice GUI.

    I'm used to either vim or SubEthaEdit which is very nice too by the way. I will definitely try Textmate!

    I've been trying to post a message on your entry entitled, "The Sad State of Mac Genealogy Software," but it simply will not accept anything. It's been several days since I last tried, but the post is still not there.

    I have tried posting with both Safari 2.0.1 and Firefox 1.5, Beta 2, on OS X 10.4.2. I would post the message here or on your next entry, but it would be a little out of context, unless you don't mind. Any ideas?
