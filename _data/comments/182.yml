    out of the global only when you need it to avoid the overhead of constructing
    it when you don''t.'

  content: "Thanks for the suggestion, Eric. It'd be interesting to see a comparison
    demonstrating the difference in performance. Route recognition is pretty snappy
    currently--we'd love for it to be snappier still. If you have some time, I'd really
    appreciate it if you could look into that.\r\n\r\nRoute recognition is rarely
    the bottleneck--route generation (which will be the next topic) is where things
    really tend to get clogged up. Routes are recognized only once per request, but
    you may need to generate lots of URL's per page. Thus, we haven't spent a lot
    of time optimizing the recognition process, yet."

  content: "<p>Jamis, these articles are beyond amazing.  I never find the time to
    go digging myself, but I do find the time to read these articles.  Long may you
    run.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I hope you realize you have a real talent for this kind of
    exposition.   In my experience it’s very rare to find someone who can write at
    just the right level of detail to explain code succinctly and clearly.  People
    often get caught up in the beauty of their abstractions, or the intricate details
    of the implementation.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’m off to throw some money in the paypal
    pot now, and I hope everyone else who reads this does, ‘cause I’d selfishly like
    to see these articles continue for a long time :)</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Cheers.</p>"

  content: "<p>Jamis, this series has rocked. I recently started trimming my list
    of blogs that I read because I was glossing over good articles such as these because
    the list of crap was so long and I felt I had to read it all. I’m very glad I
    did. Keep up the good work you’re doing an excellent service to the community.</p>"

  content: "<p>This is really cool (and amazing as to how much complexity is there
    in just one  piece of Rails!) you core people are truly amazing!</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I
    sure hope you would please continue with these, and if you ever decide to (self?)
    publish these, I will be sure to purchase a copy of your Under the Hood book.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Many
    Thanks indeed!</p>"

  content: "<p>jamis\n  I’m pretty new to rails and have been writing a way of dynamically
    generating objects at run-time and this blog was the last piece I was missing
    ( doing source generation ).  Thanks for making it easy for someone like me to
    follow. Keep the under the hood stuff coming.  Rails is one of those things that
    at first glance looks anti-climatic because its so easy, but when you look at
    the artful way the underlying code is written it really makes you sit up and take
    notice.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>-d</p>"
