    Here are my two ideas

    Tinder, because it gets something hot going quickly

    You also end up using Rails -&gt; Subversion -&gt; Tinder, and I mean who doesn't like alphabetic sequences?

    Rads, because it's fun to say, and then when you have to pitch it to higher ups you can sound huffy and say "It's the Rails Application Deployment System."

    I like Tinder.  The alphabetic sequences thing isn't serious though.

    I built a site to search through available domain names. It might help with your search, if you can find a .com that's available you might have better luck with the related trademark:
    http://instantdomainsearch.com

    Cheers!
