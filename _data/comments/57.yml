  content: "<p>@Kfz, define “all”. :) Net::SSH v2 is not working with Ruby 1.9, and
    won’t until after I release 2.0. It is known to work with 1.8.5 and 1.8.6, and
    probably works with 1.8.2 to 1.8.4 as well. It will not work with Rubies earlier
    than 1.8.2 due to missing interfaces in the Ruby OpenSSL bindings.</p>"
