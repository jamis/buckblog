  content: "<p>Hey Jamis, that’s cool stuff. I like the idea of using Rake tasks for
    doing stuff remotely. For the sake of my curiosity, could you explain the benefits/differences
    between this and the way that Vlad does it? Is there some benefit that Net::SSH::Multi
    provides that just wrapping the “ssh” command doesn’t? Thanks!</p>"

  content: "<p>@Scott, I’ve never done more than glance at vlad, so I’m probably the
    wrong person to ask. Doesn’t shelling out to ssh mean you have to reconnect for
    every command you want to execute? Net::SSH::Multi opens the connection and caches
    it, so if you are executing lots of commands in a row you might see better performance.
    Also, I don’t think vlad works on windows yet…? (As I said, I’m way out of the
    loop regarding vlad, so that might not be true any more). Net::SSH::Multi is platform
    independent, as long as OpenSSL and the OpenSSL ruby bindings are installed. At
    any rate, this isn’t out to replace vlad, or cap. It’s another tool for people
    to use, is all.</p>"

    know about the connection-caching question. Anyhow, thanks again for the great
    work on this stuff.</p>"
