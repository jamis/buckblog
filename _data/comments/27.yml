    on the instructions goto the next instruction. Going forward is what most people
    will do anyways, so why not make it easier.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Anyways, looking forward
    to this app for my daughter.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Cheers.</p>"

  content: "<p>Good idea, Trevor! It’s a little more complicated, because the instructions
    can include hyperlinks that take you to other figures, but it’s something I’ll
    look into post-v1.</p>"

  content: "<p>The obvious solution for this seems to be voice control.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Wouldn’t
    have to be very refined – basically supporting something like “next” (and “back”?),
    and it would only have to respond to those when in “hands-free mode”, not all
    the time, so there shouldn’t be a lot of noise.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>No idea what APIs
    and libs are available.</p>"

  content: <p>Mahalo for using <span class="caps">ISFA</span> notation. I’m afraid
    that mizz notations are not something that I have mastered.</p>

    to my list of things to consider.</p>"

  content: <p>@Lois, mizz code is definitely an advanced notation. It’s super useful
    once you wrap your mind around it, but that’s always the trick, isn’t it? :) if
    I do add it to Ekawada down the road, it’ll always be optional; <span class="caps">ISFA</span>
    notation will be the default.</p>

    the string, especially since the figures are to be viewed on a small screen.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Sebi, that’s a fair point. I’ll think about that and see how that
    could be made to work.</p>"

    of pictures. That would be really cool.</p>"
