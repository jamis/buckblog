  content: "<p>John, it is more generalized. Our needs at 37signals have been well
    met by Capistrano 1.x, but the needs of the community have resulted in lots improvements
    and extensions. In particular, cap2 will allow deployment by copy, instead of
    just by checkout, and this is even something we’re eager to take advantage of
    at 37signals. I’ll do a post or two in the near future outlining the changes and
    improvements, as well as upgrade caveats (it’s not 100% backwards compatible).</p>"

    in the capistrano base code itself) some of the “quick deployment” concepts that

    documentation?</p>"

  content: "<p>Greg, I would like to, certainly. I’m focusing on the core deployment
    strategies first, and will then branch out and add some more Rails-specific ones.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Scott,
    that documentation would still be “nonexistent”, sadly. I won’t release cap2 without
    some documentation, though, minimal though it may be.</p>"
