  content: "<p>Interesting poll. Lua is not, however, an object-oriented language.
    It is a multi-paradigm language which is often used with a procedural or functional
    style. Python is multi-paradigm too but it is often used as an object-oriented
    language and it has specific features to support that style.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I would
    say the reason Ruby-ists want to learn Python might be the same than why they
    want to learn R: it is widely used in the scientific community and has top-of-the-class
    libraries for numerical programming, data mining, language processing, plots…</p>"

  content: "<p>@catwell, for the purposes of my post, Lua is object-oriented “enough”.
    The term “multi-paradigm”, on the other hand, is meaningless. It really just means
    the language has features that the language designer believes fall into multiple
    different categories.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Good point about Python, though. That makes
    a lot of sense.</p>"

  content: "<p>@renan, well, Java just compiles to bytecode, and C just compiles to
    machine code. Ruby 1.8 doesn’t even compile to anything, its just converted to
    a parse tree and interpreted. You could probably even write a parser to convert
    Ruby (maybe even just a subset) to Javascript, but that doesn’t make Ruby not
    a programming language.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The target environment where the code will
    be executed doesn’t define what is a language and what isn’t. If it has a syntax,
    it’s a language, and CoffeeScript definitely fits that bill.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Theoretically,
    CoffeeScript could be compiled to any other environment; right now, it’s target
    is just Javascript.</p>"
