    and have no link to even a syntax specification from its webpage?</p>"

  content: '<p>@web design company: it’s actually remarkably <span class="caps">EASY</span>
    for it to be at 2.4.0 and have no documentation. The hard thing is to document
    something. That’s why there isn’t any. Yet. It’s a work in progress. If a lack
    of documentation is too much of a hurdle (and it definitely is, for some) then
    Capistrano probably isn’t something you’ll want to investigate at this point.
    If that’s the case, feel free to look elsewhere. My feelings won’t be hurt.</p>'

  content: <p>Awesome!  I can’t wait to use some of these features.  Capistrano has
    been really great for deploying my rails app, but I also use it to set up and
    start 2-machine debugging for my <span class="caps">OS X</span> kernel extensions!</p>

    37signals. If it isn’t, please report it as a bug on the capistrano bug tracker,
    along with steps to duplicate it.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>@Mark, yeah, Tyler Bird is heading
    up the documentation effort. It’s a slow and thankless task, unfortunately. I
    want this to be documented, but at the moment, it’s all I can do to keep myself
    motivated to apply bug fixes and such. I certainly appreciate Tyler’s efforts.</p>"

    design company:  Capistrano has an example configuration that is well documented,
    and there are a lot of examples floating around the internet.  It’s really very
    easy to get up and running.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Mark, it sounds like you’ve got an old version of git installed, which
    doesn’t like the -q switch. You can either upgrade git on your servers, or you
    can set :scm_verbose to false, which will suppress the -q switch.</p>"

  author: Jamis
  content: <p>er, I meant, set :scm_verbose to <em>true</em>, not false. The default
    is false, which means “be quiet”, which implies the -q switch. Setting that variable
    to true will prevent Capistrano from emitting the -q switch with the <span class="caps">SCM</span>
    commands.</p>

  content: "<p>I’m having trouble getting Capistrano to install with a gem, it seems
    to require the exact release of the net libs (*.0.0) instead of whatever the latest

    I want all the latest geegaws and bells and whistles.</p>"
