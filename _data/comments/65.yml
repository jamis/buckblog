  content: "<p>Hello Jamis,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’m new to RoR and Capistrano and I’m running
    into some issues deploying my new application.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>A little background:\nmy
    work station is Windows xp \n-I have svn command line and svn Tortoise installed\nI’m
    deploying to a fedora 8 box (my test box)\nMy svn is on my test box</p>\n\n\n\t<p>my
    deploy.rb file is pretty standard I have it prompt me for my svn password and
    user name and password for ssh to my fedora box.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>the problem:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>when
    I try to do a cold deploy IE cap deploy:cold Capistrano flips my slashes from
    forward to back.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>C:\\Documents and Settings\\Don\\My Documents\\NetBeansProjects\\someSoftWare\n

    seem to mix up the parameters when it does its “svn info” call</p>\n\n\n\t<p>c:/ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/capistrano
    – bla bla bla `query_revision’: tried to run `svn info—username xxx—password xxx—no-auth-cache

    ”” (RuntimeError)</p>\n\n\n\t<p>When I run it from svn command line it runs fine:</p>\n\n\n\t<p>C:\\&gt;svn

    about someone having a like problem and he solved it by Uninstalling svn Tortoise
    which seems crazy to me.  Even it worked there has to be an alternative.  Did
    I mention I’m very fond of svn Tortoise and its user interface.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thanks
    for any advice in advance</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Don</p>"
