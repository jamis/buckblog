  content: "Very interesting read Jamis. I am writting an accounting module for a
    Rails-based property rental application.\n\nThe accounting portion of the tool
    is a lot less complex because I don't have to deal with budgets or credit cards
    but it has to be a double-entry accounting system. Having said that, this module
    has been the most difficult to write. The reason is accounting is difficult in
    itself and it is challenging to write software that does the job yet is simple
    enough to use. \n\nAt any rate, I'd be very interested to hear whatever progress
    you've made and/or any code that you may release."
