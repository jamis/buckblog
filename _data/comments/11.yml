    you get it without top and left straight passages, without any markable increase
    in time complexity (for a maze n x n have to make n^2 operations, additional 2n+1
    is imho little price for better looking maze).</p>"

    accessible from others; if you remove the long corridors, you need to also make
    sure that each cell is still part of the same spanning tree somehow.</p>"
