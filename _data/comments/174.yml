  content: "<p>@Norwegian: It’s a simple song used to help children remember the English
    alphabet. When you get to the end the word “and” is inserted before the Z to help
    it fit the meter better: “W, X, Y and Z”. But a tendency for sloppy pronunciation
    among us Americans usually causes the word “and” to be pronounced the same way
    the letter N is. This particular mispronunciation is so widespread that it’s even
    transcribed into some brand names, such as “Kibbles ‘n Bits” (dog food).</p>"

  content: <p>Norwegian, the song is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_song">Alphabet
    song</a>. It ends, traditionally, with “W, X, Y and Z”, but “and”, when followed
    by a word that begins with a consonant, is generally pronounced “an”, which sounds
    like the name of the letter N (“en”). Thus, my two-year-old assuming that N follows
    Y. :)</p>

  content: "<p>Careful there, Jacob, it’s not really a mispronunciation. :) It’s simply
    how the word is pronounced in speech. Every language does this, morphing consonants
    and vowels depending on what follows them. The ‘n’ sound in Korean, for instance,
    becomes an ‘l’ if it is preceded by an ‘l’.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>No one would actually
    say “and zee”, unless they were trying to emphasize something.</p>"

  content: "<p>Heh, for Canadians it’s “and zed”.  (Lots of things don’t make sense
    when you think that way: I initially was puzzled about why the heck there would
    be a web 2.0 company called zedvents for example :-)</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Off-topic (not
    sure how to email you, so posting here): I really like your mephisto theme.  However,
    it has a bug which seems to come with the standard Mephisto theme: the sidebar
    location is hosed in IE (it begins after all the content).</p>\n\n\n\t<p>(I just
    converted a blog from Typo to Mephisto and I discovered it when testing in IE,
    and I wondered if yours had the same bug.)</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’m not sure if you care,
    but I just thought I’d mention it out of courtesy…</p>"

  content: "<p>Hey Jamis, I’m a pedant! The term for dropping parts of a word to make
    pronunciation flow is ‘elision’. It’s not mispronunciation, it’s pragmatism :).
    Languages have two tensions: 1. To facilitate ease of speech, and 2. To facilitate
    understanding.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>It’s easy to see why Ruby is a good language by being
    better than java at 1 and better than perl at 2 :)</p>"
