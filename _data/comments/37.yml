  content: "<p>Jamis,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’ve been searching the web for a copy of your
    original dungeon generator source code that you released into the public domain.
    \ Unfortunately all of the links I can find go to old ‘arrg’ site that is dead.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Do
    you have a current link for your dungeon generator code?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Much thanks,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>John</p>"

  content: "<p>Jamis,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I already sent you a couple of messages, but I
    managed to find a copy of your dungeon generator on your github site.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Unfortunately
    the code won’t compile as you have uploaded it.  It is missing a header file ‘gameutil.h’
    which defines a number of datastructures and helper routines.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Do
    you know where ‘gameutil.h’ is?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Much thanks again,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>John</p>"

  content: <p>@John, please see the <span class="caps">README</span> that is bundled
    with the code. It indicates all the dependencies (including, in this case, dnd-util,
    http://github.com/jamis/dnd-util/tree/master).</p>

  content: "<p>This is great. I’ve started using it. One question: what do you do
    with the cash money drawn from the bank account into your wallet? How do you track
    it?</p>"

  author: Jamis
  content: "<p>@Rian, easy answer: I don’t. But you could, if you wanted. Just set
    up a new account (called “Cash”), and when you withdraw money from your bank account,
    treat it as a transfer from your bank to your cash account. Then, keep track of
    your receipts and record your cash expenses against that account.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I
    don’t use cash enough to warrant the extra effort, though. Typically, I just have
    a “cash” bucket to indicate when I’ve done a cash withdrawal, and simply budget
    so much per paycheck for cash expenses.</p>"

  content: "<p>Hey Jamis,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>This is great, I’m going to play around with
    it, I created something with similar ideas a while ago and released it only as
    an iPhone web app. I didn’t put a lot into it, maybe I’ll use yours to fix it
    up.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n\n\t<p>-Chris</p>"

  content: "<p>Hey Jamis,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>great work man.  I just watched one of your
    videos showing the app, and I think it has a pretty nice user interface.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The
    only beef I got against this kind of app, is that it suffers the same problem
    as all other financial software I’ve seen: it is disconnected from the source
    of information (ie transactions made by the bank) which forces your users to manually
    punch this in.   The pattern that I’ve seen (both from myself and other people
    I know) is that a user will happily put up with this for about two months, and
    then abandon the idea (after realizing that to properly track all expenses, requires
    typing all 200 purchases  made last month… too much time and effort).</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I
    don’t mean to discourage you in anyway, but if you can find a way to allow your
    users to import this information into your app (as opposed to typing it in), you’ll
    get people to use the product on a permanent basis… just a suggestion.</p>"

  content: "<p>@J, thanks! To be honest, I’m not writing this for people who can’t
    be bothered to hand-enter their expenses. I’ve been putting up with it nicely
    for two months now, and am still going strong. There are plenty of apps out there
    that allow you to import directly from your bank account; I’m not out to compete
    with them.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Frankly, I prefer hand entering the expenses. It lets
    you (firstly) review what you’ve been spending your money on, and (secondly) categorize
    it appropriately. If you just import the expenses from the bank, you’re trusting
    your bank to get it right, and you’re missing out on a great opportunity to double
    check your spending habits.</p>"
