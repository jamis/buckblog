  content: <p>It looks like you need default_run_options[:pty] = true for <span class="caps">SVN</span>
    to work on Windows.  Otherwise, it simply asks for the password and never gets
    anywhere.</p>

  content: "<p>the :pty =&gt; true thing is actually immaterial to the OS you are
    deploying from. It depends on a variety of factors, including the remote OS version,
    whether the program doing the prompting supports interactive mode without a pty,
    and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I’ll be releasing an update soon in which :pty =&gt;
    true is the default, and you have to opt-out of the pty if you decide you don’t
    want it.</p>"

  content: "<p>Good idea.  I would suggest that (:pty =&gt; true) as a default for
    a dot release makes good sense since that is the previous and expected behavior.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I
    had to reinstall Capistrano after my Leopard upgrade and got version 2.1.  My
    first push to a shared host resulted in many cryptic errors as a result of the
    :pty change.  Luckily, the solution was easy.  However, since I have to update
    a bunch of Capfiles and will surely be re-mystified in a few months when I work
    again on an old project I missed.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>(BTW, great blog.  Just found
    this the other day for the first time and have stumbled upon it twice more lately
    while searching for esoteric Rails stuff.)</p>"

  content: <p>This <span class="caps">PTY</span> change caused problems for my calls
    to etc/init.d scripts/commands (they would hang after being run).  So I had to
    do the ‘default_run_options[:pty]’ thing. Just thought I’d put that out there
    for google.</p>
