  content: "<p>All this looks great!  Your work on these libraries really helps Ruby
    be a successful language.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I have one suggestion, though: session.via(gateway
    info here) seems like it’s a perfect match for the decorator or wrapper pattern.
    \ That is, the following code makes more sense to me:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"CodeRay
    code\"><pre class=\"true\"><code>Net::SSH::Multi.start do |outer_session|\n  #
    access servers via a gateway\n  outer_session.via 'gateway', 'gateway-user' do
    |session|\n    ... above code here ...\n  end\nend\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\t<p>That
    is, session.via should return a new session object rather than being mutable.
    \ This would allow chained gateways, though I’m not really sure anybody needs
    that.  The real advantage is the decrease on the conceptual weight of Session
    – it need only return a WrappedSession or a GatewaySessionWrapper or something
    instead of needing to keep track of the gateway information itself.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Bravo
    on the release!</p>"

  content: "<p>@James, thanks for the suggestion, I’ll take it under consideration.
    What session#via really does, though, is set the <em>default</em> gateway instance
    to use. You can specify per-session gateways with session.use(‘host’, ‘name’,
    :via =&gt; Net::SSH::Gateway.new(...)).</p>"

  content: "<p>Yeah this is great. Have been using v1 of Net::SSH &amp; Net::SFTP
    quite a bit.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The cleaned up <span class=\"caps\">SFTP</span> api
    is a nice touch – mimicing the Dir and File methods similar to how “zip/zipfilesystem”
    works makes it easy to write code that is agnostic of the method it uses to access
    files (local fs, zip, remote sftp, etc). Kind of a de-facto ruby vfs.</p>"

    being common, this is the first time in 4 years of working with Net::SSH that
    I’ve ever even heard of it. If you really want it supported, though, please look
    at providing a patch. I’d certainly consider one for that.</p>"
