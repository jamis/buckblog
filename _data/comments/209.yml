  content: "Thank you!\nFor four hours I've been trying to find out why IE was refusing
    to Print Preview a page that Opera, FireFox and NS4 all found acceptable. The
    page validated, and so did the css. No javascript. \nI chopped out a few paragraphs
    because they contained something unique to the page, and the print Preview was
    OK. I put them back, editing out the unique bit. Print Preview refused the page.
    So I've been Googling since 5 o'clock. It's 8:15 now, but I think I may have the
    answer. My troublesome passage had a heading--Tags!\nI am SO grateful to you.
    I'd never've worked that one out for myself.\nFay Johnston "

    I thought it was the *word* "tags", which worried me, because that was the subject of the passage. It wasn't quite that bad, though. I'd written
    <h3><a>Tags</a></h3>
    Having read your article and fiddled a bit, I changed it to
    <h3><a>Tags</a></h3> and print preview and all goes well.
    (Interestingly, if I went straight to Print on the troubled page, IE said I had two javascript errors. Difficult to manage without any javascript! )

    Sorry. That looks pretty meaningless. Didn't consider html was turned on.
    The bit that caused trouble was

    &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="tags"&gt;Tags&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

    and the revised version is

    &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="maryanne"&gt;Tags&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

    Now I'll stop scribbling on your pages. Thanks again. Fay
