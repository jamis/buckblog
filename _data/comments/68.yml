  content: "<p>Haha, I share your pain :)  I’ve recently found that all the administration
    involved in going self employed has sucked all my development time, so I’ve got
    loads of technical things I’ve wanted to play with for ages that have just sat
    there.  It’s really frustrating having more things you want to do than time to
    do them (although it’s actually a good sign – at least shows you’ve got some ideas!).</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Do
    you follow Getting Things Done?  I find that just writing <span class=\"caps\">EVERYTHING</span>
    down that needs to be done puts it in perspective.  At least then everything is
    just an item on a list, and not some nagging, draining worry at the back of your
    mind.</p>"

    so I may already have to break my resolution. :( I’ll do what I can, though, even
    if it is just reviewing and applying a single patch to Capistano.</p>"

  content: '<p>Applied the following Capistrano patches this afternoon: <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/10918">#10918</a>
    (Git module for Capistrano should use checkout instead of merge), <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/10922">#10922</a>
    ([PATCH] fixes the bzr export functionality), <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/10928">#10928</a>
    (bzr module should support next_revision), and <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/11107">#11107</a>
    ([PATCH] define roles as blocks). I’m particularly excited about the new dynamic
    role feature (from #11107)!</p>'

  content: "<p>Tonight: I reviewed <a href=\"http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/11137\">#11137</a>
    ([PATCH] Distributed Git support for Capistrano 2.1.0) and wanted to apply it,
    but due to other git patches I had already applied it would not apply cleanly.
    I left a note for the author to update the patch. I was able to successfully apply
    <a href=\"http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/10819\">#10819</a> (<a href=\"DOCS\"><span
    class=\"caps\">PATCH</span></a>[TINY] capistrano deploy.rb: doc s/cap setup/cap
    deploy:setup/), and I fixed bug <a href=\"http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/10093\">#10093</a>
    (cap deploy:stop brings “Couldn’t find any pid file … matching ‘dispatch.spawner.pid)
    and bug <a href=\"http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/10911\">#10911</a> (capistrano
    “cap -e” command doesn’t work in an emacs shell buffer).</p>\n\n\n\t<p>At this
    point, all Capistrano-related tickets in trac have been reviewed and commented
    on. I’m awaiting some action on a few of them, others are open pending patches
    from others. I’ll let this stew until next week to give people a chance to respond,
    and then we’ll start moving forward on a Capistrano 2.2.0 release. In the meantime,
    I’ll start moving down my todo list!</p>"

    wontfix), and <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/9947">#9947</a> (marked
    incomplete). I also sent an email to Matthew Elder (the maintainer for the Mercurial
    module in Capistrano) asking him to review <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/11187">#11187</a>.
    Lastly, I applied the patches for ”#11137”: http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/11137
    (Distributed Git support for Capistrano 2.1.0) and <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/10264">#10264</a>
    (Throttle capistrano to only run against max_hosts connections at once). The ticket
    list for Capistrano is now at a much more manageable number: four!</p>'

    (Capistrano’s Mercurial module doesn’t support prompting for <span class="caps">SCM</span>
    passwords), as well as a change suggested by James Duncan Davidson regarding an
    alternative server-centric method to define servers and roles. I then packaged
    up a preview release of Capistrano 2.2.0—please <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/2/23/capistrano-2-2-0-preview">check
    it out and give it a try</a>.</p>

    Still, once it is done, it is done. :)</p>"
