    nice writeup, jamis.

    Personally, when i hear my brain prepare a sentence with the words "just" or "only" in them, i force myself to stop and re-evaluate what i am about to say.  The problem of estimation grows exponentially as your application increases in size, as your development group experiences turnover, etc.

    There are times when i know 100% that a given thing will "just be a conf file change," but those times are few and far between.
