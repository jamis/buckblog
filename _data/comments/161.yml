    The GEM installation fails here:

    <pre>$ sudo gem install capistrano
    Attempting local installation of 'capistrano'
    Local gem file not found: capistrano*.gem
    Attempting remote installation of 'capistrano'
    Updating Gem source index for: http://gems.rubyforge.org
    ERROR:  While executing gem ... (ArgumentError)
        invalid date</pre>

    Is this a general problem or am I the only one seeing this?

    Now instead of displacing some obscure enterprise software's Google rankings, you get to displace an entire cities. :)

    Thanks for not making the upgrade too complex!

    Patrice, weird! The upgrade went smoothly for me, and others. I've not heard any other instances of that issue.

    Has anyone else encountered that? Anyone know how to work around it?

    It did work now, with the same command line. Strange.

    Should the problem come up on other computers I'm on Mac OS 10.4 with Spanish/German/English language configured in that order (language setting changes date formatting, that's why I mention that).

  content: Capistrano 1.1 requires Rake 0.7.0, because it (like the next version of
    Rails, actually) uses rake namespaces to categorize tasks. Be sure you are using
    the latest version of Rake.

    D'oh. I had the correct version of rake inside locomotive, but I was testing outside.

    Thanks, Jamis.

    Rereading the docs in Hieraki [1], I see that the list of supported scm systems is out of sync with .../gems/captistrano-1.1.0/lib/capistrano/scm [2]. Might want to change that so people who are evaluating Capistrano will see that their scm is (most probably) supported already.

    [1] http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/102#page273

    [2] Capistrano 1.1 supports Bazaar, Bazaar-NG, cvs, Darcs, Perforce and Subversion.
