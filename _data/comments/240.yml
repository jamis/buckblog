    Why bother using mkmf.rb?

    RubyInline probably does what you need without any pain.

    Upon looking at the docs, it appears that RubyInline probably would be sufficient for most of what I need. Thanks for forcing me to take a closer look at it, Eric.

    Still, mkmf _ought_ to be documented, if it's in the stdlib.
