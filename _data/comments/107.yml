  content: "<p>Hi Jamis,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Can I take you out to dinner? :) I live in
    Eugene, I’ve been in the Windows component business for 10 years, and about a
    year ago I got a Macbook Pro, installed Rails, Textmate, etc. and never looked
    back. I’ve built a wellness-management system for special populations like older
    adults, people dealing with cancer, Parkinson’s and other challenges.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>So
    if you want to escape from your relatives for a short while, please feel free
    to drop me a line at mike@wellbeyond.com.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>—Mike</p>"

    If so, you should try to make the next <a href=\"http://pdxruby.org\">pdx.rb</a>
    meeting on next Tuesday night.</p>"

    up all along our projected route, so I’ve had to cancel the trip. :( Disappointing!</p>"

    coming back from <span class=\"caps\">PDX</span> after Christmas and hit solid
    ice at Deadman Pass.  That was forty minutes of white knuckles. Luckily I had
    studded tires.  Cancelling was no doubt a good decision.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Cheers,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Scott</p>"
