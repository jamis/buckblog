    Best of luck to you and Godspeed! I'm currently trying to rescue my parents from the hell of Windows and they were very excited to switch to Mac after I told them of all the wonderful benefits.

    But, the lack of a good genealogical program has become a total deal breaker.

    I found this entry on Google. If you've found any decent alternatives since you wrote this please let me know.

    application that I could use to start myself out in Ruby. \n\nUnfortunately you
    are in the same boat as the rest of us. Nothing exciting is out there. My cousin
    wants us to use phpgedview and I guess that is what we will use. \n\nThe RoR Typo
    blog and layout you are using looks really great. I really ought to move on from
    my 2002-era Zope2 blogging software. But Zope2 + Five, Zope3, Django, Ruby On
    Rails? I cannot decide.\n\nKeep up the Ruby On Rails evangelization. It is having
    an impact. I just bought the pickaxe book. Even if I end up not doing Ruby there
    are a lot of good ideas there that apply to other languages.\n\nJonathan Mark\nGoodbyeJim.com"

    I'm a former Mac user hoping to come back into the fold.  It looks like are some good PHP-driven genealogy programs just starting to appear (e.g., http://lythgoes.net/genealogy/software.php).

    I believe this approach has much more potential than all of the standard genealogy softwae that I've seen and tried.  All the above linked software really needs is to have some Mac-like templates created for it.

  content: 'Regarding your comments on Reunion: apparently you missed the fact that
    it''s fully customizable, so if you''re looking at a "butt-ugly" screen, you change
    it easily by going to Menu&gt;Options&gt;Display. You can choose one of the pre-sets
    or set your own colors. The diagonal child buttons at the bottom you complained
    about can also be changed by clicking on the notes button on bottom right of screen
    and it will immediately give you a list view. Source capabilities are excellent...again,
    customizable. Personally, I''ve tried every Mac genealogy app out there and have
    never found a program that is as elegant, capable and easy to use as Reunion.
    It should only get better with version 9.0, which is in the pipeline and due sometime
    soon.'

  content: "I've been looking for the same thing.  I had not found Reunion in my searches,
    but after reading about it here, I tried it out.  It's probably some of the best,
    but it's user interface needs some updating, and while it's really good for user
    input, I found it's charts and reports to look kind of rough.  \r\n\r\nSince the
    state of the software is so bad, why haven't the Rails crowd (I'm just learning)
    started a competing product to phpGedView?  I'll bet they could do it better,
    faster."

    only  runs on Mac OSX 10.4 or later because it uses CoreData with an SQLite store

    go to the Goulds Genealogy website at\n\nhttp://www.gould.com.au\n\nand follow
    the links to Software / iFamilyForTiger\n\nVersion 1.0 is FREE because it does
    not include some very important functions like Sources, Reports and Charting.
    \n\niFamilyForTiger will handle 20,000 records with ease. \nIt imports and exports
    Gedcom honestly (it lists the gedcom records that it ignores)."

    To the people that like Reunion - Why would you build a database program that you can't tab to the "Add Event" pulldown menu? Stopping entry, clicking with the mouse on the pull down, scrolling (the list is alpha sensitive to keyboard inputs at least), selecting field to entry field

    Um, when I clicked on "Preferences"  (or Command+) I was met with an annoying "Preferences are in the Options Menu in Reunion. I mean WTF!!! This is a **MAC** app. It blatantly disregards STANDARD APPLE GUI INTERFACE _RULES_ (OK, they are suggestions - but the whole point is that for Mac apps you can FIND the thing you're looking for, as opposed to Windoze mayhem of progamming and interface windows of all sorts of "whimsy"). Making a drop down list as a menu item, instead of making a preferences window seems to smack of lazy programming (but hell I've not written a program so who am I?). Also "Options" are not available from all windows though the message to go to them when hitting "Command + ," **is**.

    There are some nice things in it but... as our guest noted ... just doesn't act or feel like a Mac app. Mac Family Tree is kind of neat and much prettier - but it still seems to violate some sense of logical data input and navigability - it is imaginative but also feels, well, "weird".

    Unfortunately I've had to come back to Family Tree Maker on Windoze - which is completely bogged at 8000 persons making it next to impossible to use. However, it is **very** quick to navigate, source entry is relatively easy (once you get the hang of it) but **managing** sources (i.e. I'd like to merge some and can't for the life of me figure it out). Image handling is HORRIBLE as is the "scrap book" feature and in general text entry is all ASCII and generally sucks. So so long as you're entering within fields, you're fine...

    Thanks for your efforts - can I help? Contact me...
