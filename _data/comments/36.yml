  content: "<p>I remember you started this project a few years ago right? :)  If I
    can give you a piece of advice which I gave you a couple of years ago, then recently
    contradicted myself on by ignoring this advice only to realize later that I should
    have followed it…  Take a look at Fowler’s accounting patterns.  Whenever I do
    anything that has things like accounts and transactions in it I find that the
    accounting patterns really slice and dice those concepts rather well.  You are
    writing an accounting application, it may be called buckets but those buckets
    are accounts.  Hope this helps.</p>"

    project any time on the future? I really love the concept and would love to translate
    / work on it!</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Best regards,\nFelipe.</p>"

    including Dave Ramsey, talk about.  Great idea to develop some software for it!</p>"

  content: "<p>@Tim, thanks for the tip! I actually looked at the accounting patterns
    stuff a couple years ago, but this time around I realized that its time to just
    make something work. I’ve been working on this app (in one form or another) for
    over 6 years now. The current design may be fundamentally flawed—it seems to work
    okay for me and my wife in practice, but who knows what’ll happen when more people
    start really pounding it? At any rate, one of my secret hopes for this project
    is that someone more accounting-savvy than myself will be inspired by some of
    the ideas in BucketWise and will write something more robust. :)</p>\n\n\n\t<p>@Felipe,
    there’s no real timeline for release yet, but I do intend to open-source it eventually.</p>"

  content: "<p>I respect your decision to keep BucketWise private for now. But I would
    really like to read and study your rspec/cucumber files. It would be a great exercise
    to create the application on my own using your specifications.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>And
    as to getting some feedback from the <span class=\"caps\">CPA</span> types, that
    would likely understand specifications better than code.</p>"

  content: "<p>Looks like a practical app. I think I’ll like it… and so will many
    others. One suggestion: Consider changing the header color. A forest green would
    suite it well.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Melvin, you know, I thought you might be right, so I gave it a try.
    But a dark header band makes the page feel top-heavy to me. At any rate, when
    I open up the source code (in the near future) I will certainly invite design
    patches; my own design-fu is weak, and I’m just doing enough to make it usable
    for yours truly.</p>"
