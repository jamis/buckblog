    I had a bunch of problems with TextDrive recently too.  I was running rails apps fine for several months then everything went hinky.  I think they ratcheted down the per-process memory limits to just over what a rails process normally takes, so anything slightly bigger (aka, Typo) gets memory allocation errors constantly.

    I moved to Site5 for some of my sites and PlanetArgon for my Typo blog and they are each much better.  I would personally recommend PlanetArgon.  I hear Rails Machines are great, too - but they're all sold out.

    Have fun in Boise, I almost moved there once and it's really quite nice.

    to you either way.

    Until I upgraded to 4.0, I was experiencing the same issues (though mine was crashing
    twice a day, at least). Try upgrading to 4.0, it will likely solve the issue.  '

    Yah, I'm on typo 4.0, and I'm about 99% sure it's not a memory issue. I've got a daemon running that restarts typo anytime it gets larger than some threshold, and it hasn't had to be restarted by the daemon since I upgraded to 4.0.

    The thing that's wierd is that 90% of the time when my blog goes down, lighttpd goes down, too. I get no warning--just suddenly I'll go to pull up my blog and there's no response. I check, and sure enough, both typo and lighttpd are no longer running.

    Other rails apps I run on the same host don't have this trouble, though, so it must be typo.

    Kind of odd. I'm looking into mephisto, but the trouble with that is designing a theme that suits me. We'll see how it goes.

    per process limit of 48 megs and when that threshold is reached it will just whack
    it without giving any sort of notification in the process_watchdog.log file. \n\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/typo-list@rubyforge.org/msg02897.html"

  content: Give mephisto a look.  You can import Typo into it.  It's so much better,
    imo.

  content: Thanks, Joe, for the recommendation. I've been checking it out for acouple
    weeks now--I just need to find the time to work up a theme for it.
