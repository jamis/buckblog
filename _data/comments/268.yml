    I just stumbled on your blog while googling "ruby's interface to vim" (I'm pretty sure that's how most people stumble on blogs =P).

    I'm a bigggg fan of Vim too and I wanted to write some scripts for it, but not in Vim-script, in Ruby!  If you get a chance, could you link me the Ruby/Vim interface or tutorial site, if there are any?

    Thanks in advance if you get this comment!  I'd appreciate it verryyy much, as googling around for the past half hour has led me to nothing so far =/.

    The best source of vim/ruby documentation I've seen is in the vim help pages.  Just do ":help ruby" and read away.

    Hope that helps!
