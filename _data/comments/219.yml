  content: "<p>I recently tweaked your Jamis rdoc template to use a two frame system
    and the simplest dhtml. The left frame displays only one of the three indexes
    at a time, but has a &lt;select&gt; to switch around. It also has a quick-search
    function that uses regexp matching on link titles to toggle link visibility.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Currently
    I don’t have a good place to make the template available. Anyone interested is
    welcome to contact me.</p>"
