  content: "<p>I can honestly say that your recent posts have made me think more about
    my Rails (and Ruby) development practices/knowledge than any of the books (or
    blogs, pdf’s, screencasts, etc) that I have seen or purchased (and I think I have
    all of the books to date….). I hope you can maintain the quality of the posts….even
    if the quantity decreases.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>As a very ‘part-time’ blogger, I can’t
    imagine coming up with the quality of content as often as you do. Keep up the
    good work (as often as possible ;-))</p>"

  content: "<p>Have a nice rest Jamis, you deserve it ;-)</p>\n\n\n\t<p>When you get
    back, maybe you could talk a little about using Rails components outside Rails,
    I have read an article from Richard Dale about using ActiveRecord on RubyQt at
    http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/2670 and found it very interesting and useful.</p>"

  content: "<p>Jamis, can’t tell you how interesting and helpful your posts have been.
    If some good publisher were to encourage you to put together all of your insights
    into a book, I’d be first in line. Thank you so much for all of the great writing.</p>"
