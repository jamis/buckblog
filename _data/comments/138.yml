    <p>That’s pretty neat. I tend to do a similar thing with find on ActiveRecord:</p>


    <pre>
    def self.find(n, opts = {})
      super(n, {:order =&gt; 'name'}.merge(opts))
    end
    </pre>

  content: "<p>Ryan, nifty! Be careful, though, of forcing an order like that, because
    unless ‘name’ is part of every index you use, your database is going to hate you.
    ;) Sorting cannot be done efficiently in the database unless the sort key(s) are
    part of the index that was used to satisfy the query.</p>"

    you want to see it in action, just trying and login to http://home.inklingmarkets.com

    and flash[:error] and throws up a pretty cool box at the bottom (A little green
    for notices and a little red for errors).  It was heavily inspired by the flash
    notices and errors from Shopify.  And I wanted to get it so that it was just an
    easy drop in plugin without having to change any of my flash[:error] calls to
    something else.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>But it looks like I could make it much niftier and
    maybe a bit less hackish with this tip.</p>"
