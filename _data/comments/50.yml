  content: "<p>@carlos, if the lack of documentation drives you to write your own
    capistrano clone, I say go for it! In all seriousness, and sincerity. I’d love
    for there to be more “competition” in this space.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>On the other hand,
    anything you could do to contribute to documentation would be great, too. Write
    a blog article enumerating specific questions you have about capistrano. Make
    it a long list, even! Lists like that give us a better idea of where (and how!)
    to start documenting.</p>"

    is “competition.” And it has fewer features so there’s less stuff to document
    :P</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Still, I’d say that the  documentation is very lacking aswell,
    but it is being worked on. :)</p>\n\n\n\t<pre><code>http://www.nongnu.org/fab/</code></pre>"

  content: "<p>@Christian, cool re: fabric! There are some misleading bits on the
    front page there, though, e.g. “Unlike Capistrano, Fabric want’s to stay small,
    light, easy to change and not bound to any specific framework.” I think it’d be
    silly to say any app “wants” to get “bigger, heavier, and harder to change.” I
    say “no” to as much as I say “yes”. It just happens that Capistrano is year or
    more older than Fabric, with corresponding growth rings. Also, Capistrano is not
    “bound” to Rails. It is merely the default deployment recipes that assume Rails,
    but you can use cap to deploy anything.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>At any rate, cool to see
    some competition! Thanks for pointing that out, and best of luck.</p>"
