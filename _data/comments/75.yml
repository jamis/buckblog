    though it’s relatively easy to use I don’t think most people realise what you
    can do with it.  It certainly saves me a lot of time!</p>"

  content: <p>Wow, every single one of those capistrano tips sounds great. I haven’t
    done much with it besides the normal deploy stuff and a few custom hook tasks,
    but have been dying to start getting into most of what you’ve listed as being
    in the book. I’ll definitely be picking that one up. I have such a hard time reading
    <span class="caps">PDF</span> books though so I’ll probably wait for the really
    for real paper version. Unless I get a kindle…</p>
