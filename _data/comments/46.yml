    figure out) could you give the gem command that one would issue to upgrade from
    1.4.1 to 1.4.2?  It would make this post a true one-stop.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thanks!</p>"

  content: "<p>@Sebastian, if you’re starting a new project, then I’d strongly encourage
    you to use the latest Capistrano (2.4.3 right now, though a new release is imminent).
    The 1.4.x series is not recommended for new projects.</p>"
