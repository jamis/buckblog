    "I’m sure I’ll get bombarded by complaints, no matter what I call it"

    Yep.  Honestly, I'm disappointed you caved so soon and so fast, and I don't think I like the new name, but at least the tool itself rocks -- that's what is most important anyway.

    Here's my problem with the name.  When I have a conversation (while away from a computer) with someone about this great tool for handling deployments, I'll tell them the name is "Capistrano."  The next day, they won't remember the name.  "SwitchTower" was easier to remember.

    Ryan, regarding "caving so soon and so fast," it wasn't a casual decision. We consulted an attorney, and their professional opinion was that we not fight it. True, we could have looked for a second opinion, but given that the prospect was not exactly sunny, it would have just been (IMO) wasting money and time that could be better spent elsewhere. Maybe we had a chance to fight it. Me, I'd rather be writing software than battling in court, and as the Bard said so eloquently, "What's in a name? that which we call a rose/By any other name would smell as sweet". I maintain that "so [SwitchTower] would, were [it] not [SwitchTower] call'd,/Retain that dear perfection which [it] owes/Without that title..." Capistrano is as SwitchTower does.

    I agree, Capistrano isn't the name SwitchTower was, but I like it, and just as "Firefox" eventually stopped sounding awkward, I'm sure Capistrano will stop sounding odd as well.

    Change is not comfortable, but we had no choice in this case. We're moving ahead with the new name, and we'll be back to business-as-usual in a few days.

    Good choice. And you have my deepest empathy, because three years ago I went through this exact thing with my comic strip. It was called "Overdue", but a Large Media Corporation had some compelling prior art. We actually held a contest and one of our readers chose the new one, "Unshelved". Now it's hard to remember it was ever called anything else.

    And now I'm porting our site over to RoR and am excited to use Capistrano to deploy it!

    mean you couldn't have used it.  If the existing trademark(s) had nothing to do

    give you any specific instructions on this?

    That was quite the naming challenge you've just experienced.  Looks like you guys had a really good, solid, and "un-meeting-ish" meeting to get the issue sorted quickly.  Your decision making process is very *unlike* that which I experienced while in the Navy just a few months ago.. :)

    Jamis, you've had a rough few days, so I've updated the wiki for you: http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/Capistrano

    I look forward to deploying my first "Capistrano on Rails" real soon. :)

    I'm surprised nobody has focused on the deeper issue here, that anybody could trademark the name Capistrano or the name of any other open source project without the resources to worry about trademarks and then start sending cease and desist letters to the project owners.  I really think that the idea of at least contacting the FSF about this was a good idea.

    On a side topic, I'm curious, Jamis, has 37Signals registered trademarks for all of its products?  Could you guys get a C&amp;D for Campfire or Tada lists or something like that?
- date: 2006-03-06
  author: Jamis
  content: Carl, that's not how trademarks work. You don't have to register a trademark
    to own it. Basically, as long as you can show that you've been using first, you've
    got a right to it. Registering a trademark does bring some benefits, like the
    ability to send cease and desist letters and the like, but you can't register
    a trademark that is already in use by someone else.

  content: Thanks for educating me Jamis.  I guess I'm just frustrated that you made
    some useful tool without realizing you had chosen a name that was the same as
    some other pretty much unrelated product, and suddenly when your project becomes
    very successful, they sick their lawyers on you.  It doesn't seem fair at all.  But
    I can understand and appreciate the position you are in, and your decision makes
    sense.
