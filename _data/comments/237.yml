  content: Ah, but what about RSS? When I got my iBook I decided to give Safari a
    try and was in short order hooked on its built-in RSS capabilities. I've never
    seen anything come close to giving me RSS the way I want it like Safari has.

  content: RSS never clicked for me until I started using "NetNewsWire Lite":http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/.
    It works great for me, and nothing else ever did. I never touched the RSS stuff
    in Safari.

  content: low, actually, it doesn't bother me at all. First of all, I never scroll
    that way, and secondly, if I did, I don't think having the CPU go to 100% for
    the second or two that I spend scrolling would bother me. At any rate, the features
    I get with FF are well-worth tolerating that minor annoyance. Especially when
    considered against the annoyances I've enumerated regarding Safari.

    and <a href="http://www.beatnikpad.com/archives/2005/11/29/firefox15">G5</a> optimized
    builds of Firefox 1.5 (with Firefoxy built in).

  content: I agree with your beefs against Safari in favor of Firefox (I've grumbled
    about most myself) but when it comes to hoodwinking, you don't really need GreaseMonkey.
    MouseHole it!

  content: 'Couldn''t agree more with George - the optimized versions feel a lot zippier
    and Firefoxy looks great.  I hope GrApple is up again soon, it''s lovely and I
    want it for the office machine.  Love the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1532&amp;application=firefox">
    del.icio.us extension</a> too. '

  content: The one big thing that is missing with Firefox is the lack of integration
    with the Keychain.

    Concerning GrApple, you'll find it "here":https://addons.mozilla.org/themes/moreinfo.php?id=931&amp;application=firefox

    There are some variations of the GrApple theme. To see them all, simply search on "GrApple" on the "Mozilla addons site":https://addons.mozilla.org/quicksearch.php?cof=&amp;domains=mozilla.org&amp;sitesearch=mozilla.org&amp;q=GrApple&amp;section=A

    I think it's worth trying it!

  content: I love Safari but find the memory leak(if that is the problem) to be a
    pain. With Fifrefox 1.5 and the G4/5 Deer Park browsers are a bit nicer till Apple
    fixes Safari's memory problem.

    I've never experienced any memory leaks with Safari--it's been generally very stable for me.

    I'll have to try the Deer Park versions of FF.

  content: the latest version of safari now includes a javascript error line trace,
    and it works 99% of the time.  debug menu - show javascript console will highlight
    the line in the file for you. and if you double-click the error message (or view
    source) it updates if you refresh the page.

  content: What's the latest version? I'm pretty sure I'm running the very latest
    (build 416.12), and I've still been plenty frustrated with Safari's JS error reporting.

    Have you tried Camino?
- date: 2005-12-11
  author: Jamis
  content: Shane, yes, I did, and while Camino is very pretty, it doesn't have all
    the bells and whistles of firefox, which is one of the reasons I made the move.

  content: i just did the same thing. the g4/g5 builds with the grapple themes are
    great. you just can't beat all the extensions.

  content: One feature I also miss is the integration with the dictionary. English
    is not my mother tongue, and as I often read blogs and pages in English, I often
    use ctrl+command+d to read the signification of words I don't understand.
