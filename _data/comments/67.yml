  content: "<p>Hey Jamis,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I had a query regarding the integration testing
    article on your blog… but that article probably has comments disabled… so posting
    it here.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I wanted to know the way to set session variables in integration
    tests… as in just to bypass login filters… so you do not have to deal with login
    altogether.\nCurrently I tried the following…</p>\n\n\n\t<p>get “user/something_to_initialize_sessions”
    \nsession[:user_id] = user.id\nget “user/something_that_needs_a_session_variable_set”</p>\n\n\n\t<p>And
    rails does not seem happy about it.\nI keep getting errors for the code above.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>I
    have a <span class=\"caps\">CAS</span> login filter on my controllers… so i am
    just trying to bypass it.</p>"

  content: "<p>@akshay, no, you can’t access the session that way in integration tests.
    To be honest, it’s been a long time since I was in that code, so your best bet
    will be to read the source and see how things are done there.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Now,
    back to our regularly scheduled programming… :)</p>"
