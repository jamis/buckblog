    done a fantastic job on all these projects. For one, Capistrano has been (and
    will continue to be) a huge part of my every day development process. I’m sure
    the same can be said for most other Rails developers out there. It’s become one
    of those rock-solid tools that gets out of your way and is easy to forget – something
    that not many tools achieve.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Good luck with the development reboot.
    Hopefully you can get back to having fun with what you’re good at, without the
    burden of supporting an entire community.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Cheers,</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Nathan

    Lots of people submitting patches (many of them quite good!), but no one demonstrating
    a real, general desire to dig into the internals. That’s kind of why I left it
    like I did—there really wasn’t any heir-apparent that the keys could be left to.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>That

    if there would have been a place for you to put a PayPal link on your page and
    say “Would you be interested in having Capistrano developed and supported? $5
    (or some other obscenely low amount of money that everyone could pay up)”  I’ve
    often wondered about open-source projects that are so helpful to people, and to
    so many people, that could monetize them a bit to try to keep them alive—not sure
    if it would work in the current environment, but it would be nice for the creators
    if it did. Heck, if you put a link up for some form of payment I’d pay you $5
    easily.</p>"

  content: "<p>@Greg, the thing is, I wasn’t burning out because I was doing this

    that were interesting me. Adding money to the mix wouldn’t have helped, it would
    have made it worse, because it would have <em>increased</em> my sense of obligation,
    and increased the sense of being “trapped” by Capistrano. I think it’s a common
    misconception to think that getting paid for something compensates for a lack
    of passion. Money cannot replace passion; all it does is add a sense of obligation.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The
    good news, though, is that I’ve had a few emails from folks interested in carrying
    the torch. Hopefully they’ll announce their intention somewhere and the community

    in this context is the centralization encouraged by RubyGems, Rubyforge, and the
    idea of the canonical incarnation of a project.  Communities like GitHub don’t
    supply the full solution, because much of the problem is social:  how do I know
    which incarnation to use?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Experienced coders can make decent heuristical

    too bulky, so I went with the Cap spin-off, Vlad. If it wasn’t for all your hard
    work and great ideas put into Cap though, Vlad wouldn’t exist! But now I wanted
    to roll my own deployment library for grins and giggles, and I decided to use
    your awesome Net::SSH library. Full circle baby!</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Good luck!</p>"

    commodity in the world, and you have given so much of yours to help the ‘greater
    good’.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Your post for me comes to down to ‘balance’ (whether work/life
    or other personal challenges) and the fact that nothing is forever.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>This
    message was timely for me as well, as I am going through the situation of closing
    down a company that I have built over the past few years. While I know in my heart
    nothing can be forever, the ‘human’ in me has a hard time letting go of something
    that I have put so much time and energy in to. It is reassuring to hear the perspectives
    of others who have struggled with similar issues and come out ‘alive’ on the other
    side.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Your contributions to Capistrano and other tools have brought
    success, happiness and profit to many who have used them. Your insights now are
    thoughtful and heartfelt, and will surely leave an impact on your readers much
    like Cap has left on it’s users.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Thanks for everything.</p>"
